... the watch-dogsbark_ as that part of the burthen which ‘sweet sprites bear.’ the otherpart is borne by distant watch-dogs.note vi.i. 2. 443. _i fear you have done yourself some wrong._ see this phraseused in a similar sense, _measure for measure_, i. 11. 39.note vii.ii. 1. 27. _which, of he or adrian._ ‘of’ is found in the sameconstruction, _midsummer night’s dream_, iii. 2. 336,  ‘now follow if thou darest to try whose right,  of thine or mine, is most in helena.’note viii.ii. 1. 157. _of its own kind._ there is no doubt, as dr guest has shewn,that ‘it,’ which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonlyused as a genitive in shakespeare’s time, as it is still in someprovincial dialects. ‘its,’ however, was coming into use. one instanceoccurs in this play, i. 11. 95, ‘in its contrary.’note ix.ii. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ mr spedding writes: ‘the receivedemendation is not satisfactory to me. i would rather read, “shethat--from whom? all were sea-swallow’d &c., i.e. from whom should shehave note? the report from naples will be that all were drowned. weshall be the only survivors.” the break in the construction seems to mecharacteristic of the speaker. but you must read the whole speech tofeel the effect.’note x.ii. 1. 249-251. all editors except mr staunton have printed in italics(or between inverted commas) only as far as ‘_naples?_’, but as ‘_keep_’is printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction thearrangement given in our text.note xi.ii. 1. 267. _ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe._ mr singer andmr dyce have changed ‘’twere’ to ‘it were’ for the sake of the metre.but then the first part of the line must be read with a wrong emphasis.the proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifthsyllables, ‘aý, sir; whére lies thát?’ see preface.note xii.ii. 2. 165. before ‘here; bear my bottle’ capell inserts a stagedirection [_to cal._], but it appears from iii. 2. 62, that trinculo wasentrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.note xiii.iii. 1. 15. _most busy lest, when i do it._ as none of the proposedemendations can be regarded as certain, we have left the reading of f1,though it is manifestly corrupt. the spelling ‘doe’ makes mr spedding’sconjecture ‘idlest’ for ‘i doe it’ more probable.note xiv.iii. 3. 17. the stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,is placed all at once in the folios after ‘as when they are fresh’[solemne and strange musicke; and prosper on the top (invisible:) enter... depart].pope transferred it to follow sebastian’s words, ‘i say, to night: nomore.’note xv.iii. 3. 48. _each putter out of five for one._ see beaumont andfletcher, _the noble gentleman_, i. 1. (vol. ii. p. 261, ed. moxon):‘the return will give you five for one.’ marine is about to travel.note xvi.iv. 1. 146. _you do look, my son, in a moved sort._ seymour suggests atransposition: ‘you do, my son, look in a moved sort.’ this line howevercan scarcely have come from shakespeare’s pen. perhaps the writer whocomposed the masque was allowed to join it, as best he might, toshakespeare’s words, which re-commence at ‘our revels now are ended,’&c.note xvii.iv. 1. 230. _let’s alone._ see staunton’s “shakespeare,” vol. i. p. 81,note (b).note xviii.v. 1. 309. _of these our dear-beloved solemnized._ the folios have‘belov’d’; a mode of spelling, which in this case is convenient asindicating the probable rhythm of the verse. we have written ‘beloved,’in accordance with the general rule mentioned in the preface.‘solemnized’ occurs in four other verse passages of shakespeare. it isthree times to be accented ‘sólemnized’ and once (_love’s labour’slost_, ii. 1. 41) ‘solémnized.’       *       *       *       *       *           *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *sources:the editors’ preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century) editionsare simply listed by name. the following editions may appear in thenotes. all inset text is quoted from the preface.  folios:  f1 1623; f2 (no date given); f3 1663; f4 1685.    “the five plays contained in this volume occur in the first folio    in the same order, and ... were there printed for the first time.”  early editions:  rowe 1709  pope 1715    “pope was the first to indicate the _place_ of each new scene;    as, for instance, _tempest_, i. 1. ‘on a ship at sea.’ he also    subdivided the scenes as given by the folios and rowe, making    a fresh scene whenever a new character entered--an arrangement    followed by hanmer, warburton, and johnson. for convenience of    reference to these editions, we have always recorded the    commencement of pope’s scenes.”  theobald 1733  hanmer (“oxford edition”) 1744  warburton 1747  johnson 1765  capell 1768; _also capell’s annotated copy of f2_  steevens 1773  malone 1790  reed 1803  later editions:  singer, knight, cornwall, collier, phelps, halliwell, dyce, staunton  dryden:    “_the tempest_ was altered by dryden and d’avenant, and published    as _the tempest; or the enchanted island_, in 1669. we mark the    emendations derived from it: ‘dryden’s version.’”errors and inconsistencies:  _re-enter boatswain._    [printed boatswain in small capitals]  _enter _ariel_._    [printed “ariel” in lower case]  where my son lies. when did you lose you daughter?

shakespeareby e. nesbit     “it may be said of shakespeare, that from his works may be     collected a system of civil and economical prudence.  he has     been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be     doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of     theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence     can be collected than he alone has given to his country.”--     dr. samuel johnson.prefacethe writings of shakespeare have been justly termed “the richest, thepurest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.”shakespeare instructed by delighting. his plays alone (leaving merescience out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than thewhole body of english learning. he is the teacher of all good-- pity,generosity, true courage, love. his bright wit is cut out “into littlestars.” his solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels andproverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of theenglish-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottagewhich he does not enrich. his bounty is like the sea, which, thoughoften unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. as his friend, ben jonson,wrote of him, “he was not of an age but for all time.” he ever kept thehighroad of human life whereon all travel. he did not pick out by-pathsof feeling and sentiment. in his creations we have no moral highwaymen,sentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegantadventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in whichthe grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under thesuperficial attraction of style and sentiment. he flattered no badpassion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no justand generous principle. while causing us to laugh at folly, and shudderat crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and ourreverence for ourselves.shakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, withall that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, ofthat indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, andclear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodlandsolitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements ofpoetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation tomental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, inthe midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams ofsunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged orrepulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighterelements.these things considered, what wonder is it that the works ofshakespeare, next to the bible, are the most highly esteemed of all theclassics of english literature. “so extensively have the characters ofshakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,” says an american author,--“so interwoven are these characters in thegreat body of english literature, that to be ignorant of the plot ofthese dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.”but shakespeare wrote for grown-up people, for men and women, and inwords that little folks cannot understand.hence this volume. to reproduce the entertaining stories containedin the plays of shakespeare, in a form so simple that children canunderstand and enjoy them, was the object had in view by the author ofthese beautiful stories from shakespeare.and that the youngest readers may not stumble in pronouncing anyunfamiliar names to be met with in the stories, the editor has preparedand included in the volume a pronouncing vocabulary of difficult names.to which is added a collection of shakespearean quotations, classifiedin alphabetical order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of theworld\\'s greatest dramatist.e. t. r.a brief life of shakespeare.in the register of baptisms of the parish church of stratford-upon-avon,a market town in warwickshire, england, appears, under date of april 26,1564, the entry of the baptism of william, the son of john shakspeare.the entry is in latin--“gulielmus filius johannis shakspeare.”the date of william shakespeare\\'s birth has usually been taken as threedays before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of thisfact.the family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not alwaysspelling it in the same way. while in the baptismal record the name isspelled “shakspeare,” in several authentic autographs of the dramatistit reads “shakspere,” and in the first edition of his works it isprinted “shakespeare.”halliwell tells us, that there are not less than thirty-four ways inwhich the various members of the shakespeare family wrote the name,and in the council-book of the corporation of stratford, where it isintroduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period thatthe dramatist\\'s father was a member of the municipal body, there arefourteen different spellings. the modern “shakespeare” is not amongthem.shakespeare\\'s father, while an alderman at stratford, appears to havebeen unable to write his name, but as at that time nine men out often were content to make their mark for a signature, the fact is notspecially to his discredit.the traditions and other sources of information about the occupationof shakespeare\\'s father differ. he is described as a butcher, awoolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he may havebeen all of these simultaneously or at different times, or that ifhe could not properly be called any one of them, the nature of hisoccupation was such as to make it easy to understand how the varioustraditions sprang up. he was a landed proprietor and cultivator of hisown land even before his marriage, and he received with his wife, whowas mary arden, daughter of a country gentleman, the estate of asbies,56 acres in extent. william was the third child. the two older than hewere daughters, and both probably died in infancy. after him was bornthree sons and a daughter. for ten or twelve years at least, aftershakespeare\\'s birth his father continued to be in easy circumstances. inthe year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief magistrate of stratford,and for many years afterwards he held the position of alderman as hehad done for three years before. to the completion of his tenth year,therefore, it is natural to suppose that william shakespeare would getthe best education that stratford could afford. the free school of thetown was open to all boys and like all the grammar-schools of that time,was under the direction of men who, as graduates of the universities,were qualified to diffuse that sound scholarship which was once theboast of england. there is no record of shakespeare\\'s having been atthis school, but there can be no rational doubt that he was educatedthere. his father could not have procured for him a better educationanywhere. to those who have studied shakespeare\\'s works without beinginfluenced by the old traditional theory that he had received a verynarrow education, they abound with evidences that he must have beensolidly grounded in the learning, properly so called, was taught in thegrammar schools.there are local associations connected with stratford which could notbe without their influence in the formation of young shakespeare\\'s mind.within the range of such a boy\\'s curiosity were the fine old historictowns of warwick and coventry, the sumptuous palace of kenilworth, thegrand monastic remains of evesham. his own avon abounded with spots ofsingular beauty, quiet hamlets, solitary woods. nor was stratford shutout from the general world, as many country towns are. it was a greathighway, and dealers with every variety of merchandise resorted to itsmarkets. the eyes of the poet dramatist must always have been open forobservation. but nothing is known positively of shakespeare from hisbirth to his marriage to anne hathaway in 1582, and from that datenothing but the birth of three children until we find him an actor inlondon about 1589.how long acting continued to be shakespeare\\'s sole profession we haveno means of knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that verysoon after arriving in london he began that work of adaptation by whichhe is known to have begun his literary career. to improve and alterolder plays not up to the standard that was required at the time wasa common practice even among the best dramatists of the day, andshakespeare\\'s abilities would speedily mark him out as eminently fittedfor this kind of work. when the alterations in plays originally composedby other writers became very extensive, the work of adaptation wouldbecome in reality a work of creation. and this is exactly what we haveexamples of in a few of shakespeare\\'s early works, which are known tohave been founded on older plays.it is unnecessary here to extol the published works of the world\\'sgreatest dramatist. criticism has been exhausted upon them, and thefinest minds of england, germany, and america have devoted their powersto an elucidation of their worth.shakespeare died at stratford on the 23rd of april, 1616. his father haddied before him, in 1602, and his mother in 1608. his wife survivedhim till august, 1623. his so hamnet died in 1596 at the age of elevenyears. his two daughters survived him, the eldest of whom, susanna, had,in 1607, married a physician of stratford, dr. hall. the only issue ofthis marriage, a daughter named elizabeth, born in 1608, married firstthomas nasbe, and afterwards sir john barnard, but left no children byeither marriage. shakespeare\\'s younger daughter, judith, on the 10th offebruary, 1616, married a stratford gentleman named thomas quincy, bywhom she had three sons, all of whom died, however, without issue. thereare thus no direct descendants of shakespeare.shakespeare\\'s fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists, and those who knew himin other ways, agree in expressing not only admiration of his genius,but their respect and love for the man. ben jonson said, “i love theman, and do honor his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. hewas indeed honest, and of an open and free nature.” he was buried onthe second day after his death, on the north side of the chancelof stratford church. over his grave there is a flat stone with thisinscription, said to have been written by himself:    good friend for jesus sake forbeare    to digg the dust encloased heare:    blest be ye man yt spares these stones,    and curst be he yt moves my bones.contents                                                     page     preface . . . . . . . . . .

night\\'s dreamhermia and lysander were lovers; but hermia\\'s father wished her to marryanother man, named demetrius.now, in athens, where they lived, there was a wicked law, by which anygirl who refused to marry according to her father\\'s wishes, might be putto death. hermia\\'s father was so angry with her for refusing to do ashe wished, that he actually brought her before the duke of athens toask that she might be killed, if she still refused to obey him. the dukegave her four days to think about it, and, at the end of that time, ifshe still refused to marry demetrius, she would have to die.lysander of course was nearly mad with grief, and the best thing todo seemed to him for hermia to run away to his aunt\\'s house at a placebeyond the reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to her andmarry her. but before she started, she told her friend, helena, what shewas going to do.helena had been demetrius\\' sweetheart long before his marriage withhermia had been thought of, and being very silly, like all jealouspeople, she could not see that it was not poor hermia\\'s fault thatdemetrius wished to marry her instead of his own lady, helena. she knewthat if she told demetrius that hermia was going, as she was, to thewood outside athens, he would follow her, “and i can follow him, andat least i shall see him,” she said to herself. so she went to him, andbetrayed her friend\\'s secret.now this wood where lysander was to meet hermia, and where the other twohad decided to follow them, was full of fairies, as most woods are, ifone only had the eyes to see them, and in this wood on this night werethe king and queen of the fairies, oberon and titania. now fairiesare very wise people, but now and then they can be quite as foolish asmortal folk. oberon and titania, who might have been as happy as thedays were long, had thrown away all their joy in a foolish quarrel. theynever met without saying disagreeable things to each other, and scoldedeach other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers, forfear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them there.so, instead of keeping one happy court and dancing all night through inthe moonlight as is fairies\\' use, the king with his attendants wanderedthrough one part of the wood, while the queen with hers kept state inanother. and the cause of all this trouble was a little indian boy whomtitania had taken to be one of her followers. oberon wanted the child tofollow him and be one of his fairy knights; but the queen would not givehim up.on this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the king and queen of thefairies met.“ill met by moonlight, proud titania,” said the king.“what! jealous, oberon?” answered the queen. “you spoil everything withyour quarreling. come, fairies, let us leave him. i am not friends withhim now.”“it rests with you to make up the quarrel,” said the king.“give me that little indian boy, and i will again be your humble servantand suitor.”“set your mind at rest,” said the queen. “your whole fairy kingdom buysnot that boy from me. come, fairies.”and she and her train rode off down the moonbeams.“well, go your ways,” said oberon. “but i\\'ll be even with you before youleave this wood.”then oberon called his favorite fairy, puck. puck was the spirit ofmischief. he used to slip into the dairies and take the cream away, andget into the churn so that the butter would not come, and turn the beersour, and lead people out of their way on dark nights and then laugh atthem, and tumble people\\'s stools from under them when they were going tosit down, and upset their hot ale over their chins when they were goingto drink.“now,” said oberon to this little sprite, “fetch me the flower calledlove-in-idleness. the juice of that little purple flower laid on theeyes of those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to love thefirst thing they see. i will put some of the juice of that flower onmy titania\\'s eyes, and when she wakes she will love the first thing shesees, were it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or abusy ape.”while puck was gone, demetrius passed through the glade followed by poorhelena, and still she told him how she loved him and reminded him of allhis promises, and still he told her that he did not and could not loveher, and that his promises were nothing. oberon was sorry for poorhelena, and when puck returned with the flower, he bade him followdemetrius and put some of the juice on his eyes, so that he might lovehelena when he woke and looked on her, as much as she loved him. sopuck set off, and wandering through the wood found, not demetrius, butlysander, on whose eyes he put the juice; but when lysander woke, he sawnot his own hermia, but helena, who was walking through the wood lookingfor the cruel demetrius; and directly he saw her he loved her and lefthis own lady, under the spell of the purple flower.when hermia woke she found lysander gone, and wandered about the woodtrying to find him. puck went back and told oberon what he had done,and oberon soon found that he had made a mistake, and set about lookingfor demetrius, and having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.and the first thing demetrius saw when he woke was also helena. so nowdemetrius and lysander were both following her through the wood, and itwas hermia\\'s turn to follow her lover as helena had done before. theend of it was that helena and hermia began to quarrel, and demetrius andlysander went off to fight. oberon was very sorry to see his kind schemeto help these lovers turn out so badly. so he said to puck--“these two young men are going to fight. you must overhang the nightwith drooping fog, and lead them so astray, that one will never find theother. when they are tired out, they will fall asleep. then drop thisother herb on lysander\\'s eyes. that will give him his old sight and hisold love. then each man will have the lady who loves him, and they willall think that this has been only a midsummer night\\'s dream. then whenthis is done, all will be well with them.”so puck went and did as he was told, and when the two had fallen asleepwithout meeting each other, puck poured the juice on lysander\\'s eyes,and said:--       “when thou wakest,        thou takest        true delight        in the sight        of thy former lady\\'s eye:        jack shall have jill;        nought shall go ill.”meanwhile oberon found titania asleep on a bank where grew wild thyme,oxlips, and violets, and woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. theretitania always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the enameled skinof a snake. oberon stooped over her and laid the juice on her eyes,saying:--       “what thou seest when thou wake,        do it for thy true love take.”now, it happened that when titania woke the first thing she saw was astupid clown, one of a party of players who had come out into the woodto rehearse their play. this clown had met with puck, who had clappedan ass\\'s head on his shoulders so that it looked as if it grew there.directly titania woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, “whatangel is this? are you as wise as you are beautiful?”“if i am wise enough to find my way out of this wood, that\\'s enough forme,” said the foolish clown.“do not desire to go out of the wood,” said titania. the spell of thelove-juice was on her, and to her the clown seemed the most beautifuland delightful creature on all the earth. “i love you,” she went on.“come with me, and i will give you fairies to attend on you.”so she called four fairies, whose names were peaseblossom, cobweb, moth,and mustardseed.“you must attend this gentleman,” said the queen. “feed him withapricots and dewberries, purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.steal honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with the wings ofpainted butterflies fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.”“i will,” said one of the fairies, and all the others said, “i will.”“now, sit down with me,” said the queen to the clown, “and let me strokeyour dear cheeks, and stick musk-roses in your smooth, sleek head, andkiss your fair large ears, my gentle joy.”“where\\'s peaseblossom?” asked the clown with the ass\\'s head. he did notcare much about the queen\\'s affection, but he was very proud of havingfairies to wait on him. “ready,” said peaseblossom.“scratch my head, peaseblossom,” said the clown. “where\\'s cobweb?” “ready,” said cobweb.“kill me,” said the clown, “the red bumble-bee on the top of the thistleyonder, and bring me the honey-bag. where\\'s mustardseed?”“ready,” said mustardseed.“oh, i want nothing,” said the clown. “only just help cobweb to scratch.i must go to the barber\\'s, for methinks i am marvelous hairy about theface.”“would you like anything to eat?” said the fairy queen.“i should like some good dry oats,” said the clown--for his donkey\\'shead made him desire donkey\\'s food--“and some hay to follow.”“shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts from the squirrel\\'s house?” asked the queen.“i\\'d rather have a handful or two of good dried peas,” said the clown.“but please don\\'t let any of your people disturb me; i am going tosleep.”then said the queen, “and i will wind thee in my arms.”and so when oberon came along he found his beautiful queen lavishingkisses and endearments on a clown with a donkey\\'s head.and before he released her from the enchantment, he persuaded her togive him the little indian boy he so much desired to have. then he tookpity on her, and threw some juice of the disenchanting flower on herpretty eyes; and then in a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headedclown she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had been.oberon took off the ass\\'s head from the clown, and left him to finishhis sleep with his own silly head lying on the thyme and violets.thus all was made plain and straight again. oberon and titania lovedeach other more than ever. demetrius thought of no one but helena, andhelena had never had any thought of anyone but demetrius.as for hermia and lysander, they were as loving a couple as you couldmeet in a day\\'s march, even through a fairy wood.so the four mortal lovers went back to athens and were married; and thefairy king and queen live happily together in that very wood at thisvery day.the tempestprospero, the duke of milan, was a learned and studious man, who livedamong his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his brotherantonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. but that trust wasill-rewarded, for antonio wanted to wear the duke\\'s crown himself, and,to gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love thepeople bore him. however, with the help of prospero\\'s great enemy,alonso, king of naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedomwith all its honor, power, and riches. for they took prospero to sea,and when they were far away from land, forced him into a little boatwith no tackle, mast, or sail. in their cruelty and hatred they put hislittle daughter, miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat withhim, and sailed away, leaving them to their fate.but one among the courtiers with antonio was true to his rightfulmaster, prospero. to save the duke from his enemies was impossible, butmuch could be done to remind him of a subject\\'s love. so this worthylord, whose name was gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some freshwater, provisions, and clothes, and what prospero valued most of all,some of his precious books.the boat was cast on an island, and prospero and his little one landedin safety. now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain underthe spell of a fell witch, sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunksof trees all the good spirits she found there. she died shortly beforeprospero was cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom ariel wasthe chief, still remained in their prisons.prospero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almostentirely to the study of magic during the years in which he allowedhis brother to manage the affairs of milan. by his art he set free theimprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they weremore truly his subjects than his people in milan had been. for hetreated them kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he exercisedhis power over them wisely and well. one creature alone he found itnecessary to treat with harshness: this was caliban, the son of thewicked old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to look on, andvicious and brutal in all his habits.when miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, itchanced that antonio and alonso, with sebastian, his brother, andferdinand, his son, were at sea together with old gonzalo, and theirship came near prospero\\'s island. prospero, knowing they were there,raised by his art a great storm, so that even the sailors on board gavethemselves up for lost; and first among them all prince ferdinand leapedinto the sea, and, as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. butariel brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, althoughthey were washed overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts ofthe island, and the good ship herself, which they all thought had beenwrecked, lay at anchor in the harbor whither ariel had brought her. suchwonders could prospero and his spirits perform.while yet the tempest was raging, prospero showed his daughter the braveship laboring in the trough of the sea, and told her that it was filledwith living human beings like themselves. she, in pity of their lives,prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it. then her father badeher to have no fear, for he intended to save every one of them.then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers,and that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies,antonio and alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into hishands.when he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, forariel was at hand, and he had work for him to do. ariel, who longedfor his complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on beingthreateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone whensycorax ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to themaster who had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, andpromised faithfully to do whatever prospero might command.“do so,” said prospero, “and in two days i will discharge thee.”then he bade ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in searchof the young prince. and ariel, invisible to ferdinand, hovered nearhim, singing the while--   “come unto these yellow sands      and then take hands:    court\\'sied when you have, and kiss\\'d      (the wild waves whist),    foot it featly here and there;    and, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”and ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to asolemn air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to hiseyes, for thus they ran--   “full fathom five thy father lies;      of his bones are coral made.    those are pearls that were his eyes,      nothing of him that doth fade,    but doth suffer a sea-change    into something rich and strange.    sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.    hark! now i hear them,-- ding dong bell!”and so singing, ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence ofprospero and miranda. then, behold! all happened as prospero desired.for miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seenany human being save her father, looked on the youthful prince withreverence in her eyes, and love in her secret heart.“i might call him,” she said, “a thing divine, for nothing natural iever saw so noble!”and ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--“most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!”nor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, forscarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed tomake her his queen if she were willing. but prospero, though secretlydelighted, pretended wrath.“you come here as a spy,” he said to ferdinand. “i will manacle yourneck and feet together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels,withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to drink. follow.”“no,” said ferdinand, and drew his sword. but on the instant prosperocharmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; andmiranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. but heharshly refused her, and made ferdinand follow him to his cell. therehe set the prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs oftimber and pile them up; and ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought histoil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet miranda.she in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he wouldnot let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, andshe, hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.then prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, hegave his consent to their marriage.“take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”in the meantime, antonio and sebastian in another part of the islandwere plotting the murder of alonso, the king of naples, for ferdinandbeing dead, as they thought, sebastian would succeed to the throne onalonso\\'s death. and they would have carried out their wicked purposewhile their victim was asleep, but that ariel woke him in good time.many tricks did ariel play them. once he set a banquet before them, andjust as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunderand lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquetdisappeared. then ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without hiscell, where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterlyrepenting them of their sins.prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, “and then,” said he, “i\\'ll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet soundi\\'ll drown my book.”so he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them inhis proper shape as the duke of milan. because they repented, heforgave them and told them the story of his life since they had cruellycommitted him and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves.alonso, who seemed sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamentedthe loss of his heir. but prospero drew back a curtain and showed themferdinand and miranda playing at chess. great was alonso\\'s joy to greethis loved son again, and when he heard that the fair maid with whomferdinand was playing was prospero\\'s daughter, and that the young folkshad plighted their troth, he said--“give me your hands, let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart thatdoth not wish you joy.”so all ended happily. the ship was safe in the harbor, and next day theyall set sail for naples, where ferdinand and miranda were to be married.ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were therejoicings at the wedding.then prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his owndukedom, where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects.he practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and notonly because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when hisbitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he tookno vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.as for ariel, prospero made him free as air, so that he could wanderwhere he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--   “where the bee sucks, there suck i:    in a cowslip\\'s bell i lie;    there i couch when owls do cry.    on the bat\\'s back i do fly    after summer, merrily:    merrily, merrily, shall i live now,    under the blossom that hangs on the bough.”as you like itthere was once a wicked duke named frederick, who took the dukedom thatshould have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. hisbrother went into the forest of arden, where he lived the life of a boldforester, as robin hood did in sherwood forest in merry england.the banished duke\\'s daughter, rosalind, remained with celia, frederick\\'sdaughter, and the two loved each other more than most sisters. one daythere was a wrestling match at court, and rosalind and celia went to seeit. charles, a celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many menin contests of this kind. orlando, the young man he was to wrestle with,was so slender and youthful, that rosalind and celia thought he wouldsurely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to him, and askedhim not to attempt so dangerous an adventure; but the only effect oftheir words was to make him wish more to come off well in the encounter,so as to win praise from such sweet ladies.orlando, like rosalind\\'s father, was being kept out of his inheritanceby his brother, and was so sad at his brother\\'s unkindness that, untilhe saw rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. but nowthe sight of the fair rosalind gave him strength and courage, so thathe did marvelously, and at last, threw charles to such a tune, that thewrestler had to be carried off the ground. duke frederick was pleasedwith his courage, and asked his name.“my name is orlando, and i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys,” said the young man.now sir rowland de boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend tothe banished duke, so that frederick heard with regret whose son orlandowas, and would not befriend him. but rosalind was delighted to hear thatthis handsome young stranger was the son of her father\\'s old friend, andas they were going away, she turned back more than once to say anotherkind word to the brave young man.“gentleman,” she said, giving him a chain from her neck, “wear this forme. i could give more, but that my hand lacks means.”rosalind and celia, when they were alone, began to talk about thehandsome wrestler, and rosalind confessed that she loved him at firstsight.“come, come,” said celia, “wrestle with thy affections.”“oh,” answered rosalind, “they take the part of a better wrestler thanmyself. look, here comes the duke.”“with his eyes full of anger,” said celia.“you must leave the court at once,” he said to rosalind. “why?” sheasked.“never mind why,” answered the duke, “you are banished. if within tendays you are found within twenty miles of my court, you die.”so rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished duke, in the forestof arden. celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it wasrather a dangerous journey, rosalind, being the taller, dressed up asa young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and rosalind saidthat she would be called ganymede, and celia, aliena. they were verytired when at last they came to the forest of arden, and as they weresitting on the grass a countryman passed that way, and ganymedeasked him if he could get them food. he did so, and told them thata shepherd\\'s flocks and house were to be sold. they bought these andsettled down as shepherd and shepherdess in the forest.in the meantime, oliver having sought to take his brother orlando\\'slife, orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with therightful duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. now, orlandocould think of nothing but rosalind, and he went about the forestcarving her name on trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them onthe bushes, and there rosalind and celia found them. one day orlando metthem, but he did not know rosalind in her boy\\'s clothes, though he likedthe pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to herhe loved.“there is a foolish lover,” said rosalind, “who haunts these woods andhangs sonnets on the trees. if i could find him, i would soon cure himof his folly.”orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and rosalind said--“ifyou will come and see me every day, i will pretend to be rosalind, and iwill take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,till i make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.”and so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying toher all the pretty things he would have said to rosalind; and she hadthe fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to theright ears. thus many days passed pleasantly away.one morning, as orlando was going to visit ganymede, he saw a man asleepon the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting forthe man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey onanything that is dead or sleeping. then orlando looked at the man, andsaw that it was his wicked brother, oliver, who had tried to take hislife. he fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother\\'slife.while orlando was fighting the lioness, oliver woke to see his brother,whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the riskof his own life. this made him repent of his wickedness, and he beggedorlando\\'s pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. thelioness had wounded orlando\\'s arm so much, that he could not go on tosee the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask ganymede to come to him.oliver went and told the whole story to ganymede and aliena, and alienawas so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that shefell in love with him at once. but when ganymede heard of the dangerorlando had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, saidtruly enough, “i should have been a woman by right.”oliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, “i lovealiena so well that i will give up my estates to you and marry her, andlive here as a shepherd.”“let your wedding be to-morrow,” said orlando, “and i will ask the dukeand his friends.”when orlando told ganymede how his brother was to be married on themorrow, he added: “oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happinessthrough another man\\'s eyes.”then answered rosalind, still in ganymede\\'s dress and speaking with hisvoic--“if you do love rosalind so near the heart, then when your brothermarries aliena, shall you marry her.”now the next day the duke and his followers, and orlando, and oliver,and aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.then ganymede came in and said to the duke, “if i bring in your daughterrosalind, will you give her to orlando here?” “that i would,” said theduke, “if i had all kingdoms to give with her.”“and you say you will have her when i bring her?” she said to orlando.“that would i,” he answered, “were i king of all kingdoms.”then rosalind and celia went out, and rosalind put on her pretty woman\\'sclothes again, and after a while came back.she turned to her father--“i give myself to you, for i am yours.” “ifthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my daughter.”then she said to orlando, “i give myself to you, for i am yours.” “ifthere be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my rosalind.”“i will have no father if you be not he,” she said to the duke, and toorlando, “i will have no husband if you be not he.”so orlando and rosalind were married, and oliver and celia, and theylived happy ever after, returning with the duke to the kingdom. forfrederick had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways,and so gave back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into amonastery to pray for forgiveness.the wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. ashepherd and shepherdess who had been friends with rosalind, when shewas herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, andall with such pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowherewithin four walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.the winter\\'s taleleontes was the king of sicily, and his dearest friend was polixenes,king of bohemia. they had been brought up together, and only separatedwhen they reached man\\'s estate and each had to go and rule overhis kingdom. after many years, when each was married and had a son,polixenes came to stay with leontes in sicily.leontes was a violent-tempered man and rather silly, and he took it intohis stupid head that his wife, hermione, liked polixenes better thanshe did him, her own husband. when once he had got this into his head,nothing could put it out; and he ordered one of his lords, camillo, toput a poison in polixenes\\' wine. camillo tried to dissuade him from thiswicked action, but finding he was not to be moved, pretended to consent.he then told polixenes what was proposed against him, and they fled fromthe court of sicily that night, and returned to bohemia, where camillolived on as polixenes\\' friend and counselor.leontes threw the queen into prison; and her son, the heir to thethrone, died of sorrow to see his mother so unjustly and cruellytreated.while the queen was in prison she had a little baby, and a friend ofhers, named paulina, had the baby dressed in its best, and took it toshow the king, thinking that the sight of his helpless little daughterwould soften his heart towards his dear queen, who had never done himany wrong, and who loved him a great deal more than he deserved; but theking would not look at the baby, and ordered paulina\\'s husband to takeit away in a ship, and leave it in the most desert and dreadful placehe could find, which paulina\\'s husband, very much against his will, wasobliged to do.then the poor queen was brought up to be tried for treason in preferringpolixenes to her king; but really she had never thought of anyone exceptleontes, her husband. leontes had sent some messengers to ask the god,apollo, whether he was not right in his cruel thoughts of the queen. buthe had not patience to wait till they came back, and so it happened thatthey arrived in the middle of the trial. the oracle said--“hermione is innocent, polixenes blameless, camillo a true subject,leontes a jealous tyrant, and the king shall live without an heir, ifthat which is lost be not found.”then a man came and told them that the little prince was dead. thepoor queen, hearing this, fell down in a fit; and then the king saw howwicked and wrong he had been. he ordered paulina and the ladies who werewith the queen to take her away, and try to restore her. but paulinacame back in a few moments, and told the king that hermione was dead.now leontes\\' eyes were at last opened to his folly. his queen was dead,and the little daughter who might have been a comfort to him he had sentaway to be the prey of wolves and kites. life had nothing left for himnow. he gave himself up to his grief, and passed in any sad years inprayer and remorse.the baby princess was left on the seacoast of bohemia, the very kingdomwhere polixenes reigned. paulina\\'s husband never went home to tellleontes where he had left the baby; for as he was going back to theship, he met a bear and was torn to pieces. so there was an end of him.but the poor deserted little baby was found by a shepherd. she wasrichly dressed, and had with her some jewels, and a paper was pinned toher cloak, saying that her name was perdita, and that she came of nobleparents.the shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took home the little baby tohis wife, and they brought it up as their own child. she had no moreteaching than a shepherd\\'s child generally has, but she inherited fromher royal mother many graces and charms, so that she was quite differentfrom the other maidens in the village where she lived.one day prince florizel, the son of the good king of bohemia, wasbunting near the shepherd\\'s house and saw perdita, now grown up to acharming woman. he made friends with the shepherd, not telling him thathe was the prince, but saying that his name was doricles, and that hewas a private gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the prettyperdita, he came almost daily to see her.the king could not understand what it was that took his son nearly everyday from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out thatthe heir of the king of bohemia was in love with perdita, the prettyshepherd girl. polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true,disguised himself, and went with the faithful camillo, in disguisetoo, to the old shepherd\\'s house. they arrived at the feast ofsheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were made very welcome.there was dancing going on, and a peddler was selling ribbons and lacesand gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.florizel and perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene,but sat quietly together talking. the king noticed the charming mannersand great beauty of perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter ofhis old friend, leontes. he said to camillo--“this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the greensward. nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater thanherself--too noble for this place.”and camillo answered, “in truth she is the queen of curds and cream.”but when florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon thestrangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the kingmade himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she sawflorizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; andwith that he left them. but camillo remained behind, for he was charmedwith perdita, and wished to befriend her.camillo had long known how sorry leontes was for that foolish madness ofhis, and he longed to go back to sicily to see his old master. he nowproposed that the young people should go there and claim the protectionof leontes. so they went, and the shepherd went with them, takingperdita\\'s jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned toher cloak.leontes received them with great kindness. he was very polite to princeflorizel, but all his looks were for perdita. he saw how much she waslike the queen hermione, and said again and again--“such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if i had not cruellysent her from me.”when the old shepherd heard that the king had lost a baby daughter, whohad been left upon the coast of bohemia, he felt sure that perdita, thechild he had reared, must be the king\\'s daughter, and when he toldhis tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the king perceived thatperdita was indeed his long-lost child. he welcomed her with joy, andrewarded the good shepherd.polixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage withperdita, but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend,he was only too glad to give his consent.yet leontes could not be happy. he remembered how his fair queen,who should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter\\'shappiness, was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing fora long time but--“oh, thy mother! thy mother!” and ask forgiveness of the king ofbohemia, and then kiss his daughter again, and then the prince florizel,and then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.then paulina, who had been high all these years in the king\\'s favor,because of her kindness to the dead queen hermione, said--“i have astatue made in the likeness of the dead queen, a piece many years indoing, and performed by the rare italian master, giulio romano. i keepit in a private house apart, and there, ever since you lost your queen,i have gone twice or thrice a day. will it please your majesty to go andsee the statue?”so leontes and polixenes, and florizel and perdita, with camillo andtheir attendants, went to paulina\\'s house where there was a heavy purplecurtain screening off an alcove; and paulina, with her hand on thecurtain, said--“she was peerless when she was alive, and i do believe that her deadlikeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the handof man hath done. therefore i keep it lonely, apart. but here itis--behold, and say, \\'tis well.”and with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. theking gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but saidnothing.“i like your silence,” said paulina; “it the more shows off your wonder.but speak, is it not like her?”“it is almost herself,” said the king, “and yet, paulina, hermione wasnot so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.”“oh, not by much,” said polixenes.“al,” said paulina, “that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows herto us as she would have been had she lived till now.”and still leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.“if i had known,” said paulina, “that this poor image would so havestirred your grief, and love, i would not have shown it to you.”but he only answered, “do not draw the curtain.”“no, you must not look any longer,” said paulina, “or you will think itmoves.”“let be! let be!” said the king. “would you not think it breathed?”“i will draw the curtain,” said paulina; “you will think it livespresently.”“ah, sweet paulina,” said leontes, “make me to think so twenty yearstogether.”“if you can bear it,” said paulina, “i can make the statue move, makeit come down and take you by the hand. only you would think it was bywicked magic.”“whatever you can make her do, i am content to look on,” said the king.and then, all folks there admiring and beholding, the statue moved fromits pedestal, and came down the steps and put its arms round the king\\'sneck, and he held her face and kissed her many times, for this wasno statue, but the real living queen hermione herself. she had livedhidden, by paulina\\'s kindness, all these years, and would not discoverherself to her husband, though she knew he had repented, because shecould not quite forgive him till she knew what had become of her littlebaby.now that perdita was found, she forgave her husband everything, and itwas like a new and beautiful marriage to them, to be together once more.florizel and perdita were married and lived long and happily.to leontes his many years of suffering were well paid for in the momentwhen, after long grief and pain, he felt the arms of his true lovearound him once again.king learking lear was old and tired. he was aweary of the business of hiskingdom, and wished only to end his days quietly near his threedaughters. two of his daughters were married to the dukes of albanyand cornwall; and the duke of burgundy and the king of france were bothsuitors for the hand of cordelia, his youngest daughter.lear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposedto divide his kingdom between them. “but first,” said he, “i should liketo know much you love me.”goneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her fatherat all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved himdearer than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health,beauty, and honor.“i love you as much as my sister and more,” professed regan, “since icare for nothing but my father\\'s love.”lear was very much pleased with regan\\'s professions, and turned to hisyoungest daughter, cordelia. “now, our joy, though last not least,” hesaid, “the best part of my kingdom have i kept for you. what can yousay?”“nothing, my lord,” answered cordelia.“nothing can come of nothing. speak again,” said the king.and cordelia answered, “i love your majesty according to my duty--nomore, no less.”and this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which hersisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense ofduty to their old father.“i am your daughter,” she went on, “and you have brought me up and lovedme, and i return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you,love you, and most honor you.”lear, who loved cordelia best, had wished her to make more extravagantprofessions of love than her sisters. “go,” he said, “be for ever astranger to my heart and me.”the earl of kent, one of lear\\'s favorite courtiers and captains, triedto say a word for cordelia\\'s sake, but lear would not listen. he dividedthe kingdom between goneril and regan, and told them that he should onlykeep a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters byturns.when the duke of burgundy knew that cordelia would have no share of thekingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. but the king of france waswiser, and said, “thy dowerless daughter, king, is queen of us--of ours,and our fair france.”“take her, take her,” said the king; “for i will never see that face ofhers again.”so cordelia became queen of france, and the earl of kent, for havingventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. the king nowwent to stay with his daughter goneril, who had got everything from herfather that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundredknights that he had reserved for himself. she was harsh and undutifulto him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretendedthat they did not hear them.now the earl of kent, when he was banished, made as though he wouldgo into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise ofa servingman and took service with the king. the king had now twofriends--the earl of kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and hisfool, who was faithful to him. goneril told her father plainly that hisknights only served to fill her court with riot and feasting; and so shebegged him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.“my train are men who know all parts of duty,” said lear. “goneril, iwill not trouble you further--yet i have left another daughter.”and his horses being saddled, he set out with his followers for thecastle of regan. but she, who had formerly outdone her sister inprofessions of attachment to the king, now seemed to outdo her inundutiful conduct, saying that fifty knights were too many to wait onhim, and goneril (who had hurried thither to prevent regan showing anykindness to the old king) said five were too many, since her servantscould wait on him.then when lear saw that what they really wanted was to drive him away,he left them. it was a wild and stormy night, and he wandered about theheath half mad with misery, and with no companion but the poor fool.but presently his servant, the good earl of kent, met him, and at lastpersuaded him to lie down in a wretched little hovel. at daybreak theearl of kent removed his royal master to dover, and hurried to the courtof france to tell cordelia what had happened.cordelia\\'s husband gave her an army and with it she landed at dover.here she found poor king lear, wandering about the fields, wearing acrown of nettles and weeds. they brought him back and fed and clothedhim, and cordelia came to him and kissed him.“you must bear with me,” said lear; “forget and forgive. i am old andfoolish.”and now he knew at last which of his children it was that had loved himbest, and who was worthy of his love.goneril and regan joined their armies to fight cordelia\\'s army, and weresuccessful; and cordelia and her father were thrown into prison. thengoneril\\'s husband, the duke of albany, who was a good man, and had notknown how wicked his wife was, heard the truth of the whole story; andwhen goneril found that her husband knew her for the wicked woman shewas, she killed herself, having a little time before given a deadlypoison to her sister, regan, out of a spirit of jealousy.but they had arranged that cordelia should be hanged in prison, andthough the duke of albany sent messengers at once, it was too late. theold king came staggering into the tent of the duke of albany, carryingthe body of his dear daughter cordelia, in his arms.and soon after, with words of love for her upon his lips, he fell withher still in his arms, and died.twelfth nightorsino, the duke of illyria, was deeply in love with a beautifulcountess named olivia. yet was all his love in vain, for she disdainedhis suit; and when her brother died, she sent back a messenger from theduke, bidding him tell his master that for seven years she would notlet the very air behold her face, but that, like a nun, she would walkveiled; and all this for the sake of a dead brother\\'s love, which shewould keep fresh and lasting in her sad remembrance.the duke longed for someone to whom he could tell his sorrow, and repeatover and over again the story of his love. and chance brought him such acompanion. for about this time a goodly ship was wrecked on the illyriancoast, and among those who reached land in safety were the captain anda fair young maid, named viola. but she was little grateful for beingrescued from the perils of the sea, since she feared that her twinbrother was drowned, sebastian, as dear to her as the heart in herbosom, and so like her that, but for the difference in their manner ofdress, one could hardly be told from the other. the captain, for hercomfort, told her that he had seen her brother bind himself “to a strongmast that lived upon the sea,” and that thus there was hope that hemight be saved.viola now asked in whose country she was, and learning that the youngduke orsino ruled there, and was as noble in his nature as in his name,she decided to disguise herself in male attire, and seek for employmentwith him as a page.in this she succeeded, and now from day to day she had to listen to thestory of orsino\\'s love. at first she sympathized very truly with him,but soon her sympathy grew to love. at last it occurred to orsino thathis hopeless love-suit might prosper better if he sent this pretty ladto woo olivia for him. viola unwillingly went on this errand, but whenshe came to the house, malvolio, olivia\\'s steward, a vain, officiousman, sick, as his mistress told him, of self-love, forbade the messengeradmittance.viola, however (who was now called cesario), refused to take any denial,and vowed to have speech with the countess. olivia, hearing how herinstructions were defied and curious to see this daring youth, said,“we\\'ll once more hear orsino\\'s embassy.”when viola was admitted to her presence and the servants had been sentaway, she listened patiently to the reproaches which this bold messengerfrom the duke poured upon her, and listening she fell in love with thesupposed cesario; and when cesario had gone, olivia longed to send somelove-token after him. so, calling malvolio, she bade him follow the boy.“he left this ring behind him,” she said, taking one from her finger.“tell him i will none of it.”malvolio did as he was bid, and then viola, who of course knew perfectlywell that she had left no ring behind her, saw with a woman\\'s quicknessthat olivia loved her. then she went back to the duke, very sad at heartfor her lover, and for olivia, and for herself.it was but cold comfort she could give orsino, who now sought to easethe pangs of despised love by listening to sweet music, while cesariostood by his side.“ah,” said the duke to his page that night, “you too have been in love.”“a little,” answered viola.“what kind of woman is it?” he asked.“of your complexion,” she answered.“what years, i\\' faith?” was his next question.to this came the pretty answer, “about your years, my lord.”“too old, by heaven!” cried the duke. “let still the woman take an elderthan herself.”and viola very meekly said, “i think it well, my lord.”by and by orsino begged cesario once more to visit olivia and to pleadhis love-suit. but she, thinking to dissuade him, said--“if some lady loved you as you love olivia?”“ah! that cannot be,” said the duke.“but i know,” viola went on, “what love woman may have for a man. myfather had a daughter loved a man, as it might be,” she added blushing,“perhaps, were i a woman, i should love your lordship.”“and what is her history?” he asked.“a blank, my lord,” viola answered. “she never told her love, but letconcealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek: shepined in thought, and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat, likepatience on a monument, smiling at grief. was not this love indeed?”“but died thy sister of her love, my boy?” the duke asked; and viola,who had all the time been telling her own love for him in this prettyfashion, said--“i am all the daughters my father has and all the brothers-- sir, shalli go to the lady?”“to her in haste,” said the duke, at once forgetting all about thestory, “and give her this jewel.”so viola went, and this time poor olivia was unable to hide her love,and openly confessed it with such passionate truth, that viola left herhastily, saying--“nevermore will i deplore my master\\'s tears to you.”but in vowing this, viola did not know the tender pity she would feelfor other\\'s suffering. so when olivia, in the violence of her love,sent a messenger, praying cesario to visit her once more, cesario had noheart to refuse the request.but the favors which olivia bestowed upon this mere page aroused thejealousy of sir andrew aguecheek, a foolish, rejected lover of hers, whoat that time was staying at her house with her merry old uncle sir toby.this same sir toby dearly loved a practical joke, and knowing sir andrewto be an arrant coward, he thought that if he could bring off a duelbetween him and cesario, there would be rare sport indeed. so he inducedsir andrew to send a challenge, which he himself took to cesario. thepoor page, in great terror, said--“i will return again to the house, i am no fighter.”“back you shall not to the house,” said sir toby, “unless you fight mefirst.”and as he looked a very fierce old gentleman, viola thought it best toawait sir andrew\\'s coming; and when he at last made his appearance, ina great fright, if the truth had been known, she tremblingly drew hersword, and sir andrew in like fear followed her example. happily forthem both, at this moment some officers of the court came on the scene,and stopped the intended duel. viola gladly made off with what speed shemight, while sir toby called after her--“a very paltry boy, and more a coward than a hare!”now, while these things were happening, sebastian had escaped allthe dangers of the deep, and had landed safely in illyria, where hedetermined to make his way to the duke\\'s court. on his way thither hepassed olivia\\'s house just as viola had left it in such a hurry, andwhom should he meet but sir andrew and sir toby. sir andrew, mistakingsebastian for the cowardly cesario, took his courage in both hands, andwalking up to him struck him, saying, “there\\'s for you.”“why, there\\'s for you; and there, and there!” said sebastian, bittingback a great deal harder, and again and again, till sir toby came tothe rescue of his friend. sebastian, however, tore himself free from sirtoby\\'s clutches, and drawing his sword would have fought them both, butthat olivia herself, having heard of the quarrel, came running in, andwith many reproaches sent sir toby and his friend away. then turningto sebastian, whom she too thought to be cesario, she besought him withmany a pretty speech to come into the house with her.sebastian, half dazed and all delighted with her beauty and grace,readily consented, and that very day, so great was olivia\\'s baste,they were married before she had discovered that he was not cesario, orsebastian was quite certain whether or not he was in a dream.meanwhile orsino, hearing how ill cesario sped with olivia, visited herhimself, taking cesario with him. olivia met them both before herdoor, and seeing, as she thought, her husband there, reproached him forleaving her, while to the duke she said that his suit was as fat andwholesome to her as howling after music.“still so cruel?” said orsino.“still so constant,” she answered.then orsino\\'s anger growing to cruelty, he vowed that, to be revenged onher, he would kill cesario, whom he knew she loved. “come, boy,” he saidto the page.and viola, following him as he moved away, said, “i, to do you rest, athousand deaths would die.”a great fear took hold on olivia, and she cried aloud, “cesario,husband, stay!”“her husband?” asked the duke angrily.“no, my lord, not i,” said viola.“call forth the holy father,” cried olivia.and the priest who had married sebastian and olivia, coming in, declaredcesario to be the bridegroom.“o thou dissembling cub!” the duke exclaimed. “farewell, and take her,but go where thou and i henceforth may never meet.”at this moment sir andrew came up with bleeding crown, complaining thatcesario had broken his head, and sir toby\\'s as well.“i never hurt you,” said viola, very positively; “you drew your sword onme, but i bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.”yet, for all her protesting, no one there believed her; but all theirthoughts were on a sudden changed to wonder, when sebastian came in.“i am sorry, madam,” he said to his wife, “i have hurt your kinsman.pardon me, sweet, even for the vows we made each other so late ago.”“one face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!” cried the duke,looking first at viola, and then at sebastian.“an apple cleft in two,” said one who knew sebastian, “is not more twinthan these two creatures. which is sebastian?”“i never had a brother,” said sebastian. “i had a sister, whom the blindwaves and surges have devoured.” “were you a woman,” he said to viola,“i should let my tears fall upon your cheek, and say, \\'thrice welcome,drowned viola!\\'”then viola, rejoicing to see her dear brother alive, confessed that shewas indeed his sister, viola. as she spoke, orsino felt the pity that isakin to love.“boy,” he said, “thou hast said to me a thousand times thou nevershouldst love woman like to me.”“and all those sayings will i overswear,” viola replied, “and all thoseswearings keep true.”“give me thy hand,” orsino cried in gladness. “thou shalt be my wife,and my fancy\\'s queen.”thus was the gentle viola made happy, while olivia found in sebastiana constant lover, and a good husband, and he in her a true and lovingwife.much ado about nothingin sicily is a town called messina, which is the scene of a curiousstorm in a teacup that raged several hundred years ago.it began with sunshine. don pedro, prince of arragon, in spain, hadgained so complete a victory over his foes that the very land whencethey came is forgotten. feeling happy and playful after the fatigues ofwar, don pedro came for a holiday to messina, and in his suite were hisstepbrother don john and two young italian lords, benedick and claudio.benedick was a merry chatterbox, who had determined to live a bachelor.claudio, on the other hand, no sooner arrived at messina than he fell inlove with hero, the daughter of leonato, governor of messina.one july day, a perfumer called borachio was burning dried lavender ina musty room in leonato\\'s house, when the sound of conversation floatedthrough the open window.“give me your candid opinion of hero,” claudio, asked, and borachiosettled himself for comfortable listening.“too short and brown for praise,” was benedick\\'s reply; “but alter hercolor or height, and you spoil her.”“in my eyes she is the sweetest of women,” said claudio.“not in mine,” retorted benedick, “and i have no need for glasses. sheis like the last day of december compared with the first of may if youset her beside her cousin. unfortunately, the lady beatrice is a fury.”beatrice was leonato\\'s niece. she amused herself by saying witty andsevere things about benedick, who called her dear lady disdain. shewas wont to say that she was born under a dancing star, and could nottherefore be dull.claudio and benedick were still talking when don pedro came up and saidgood-humoredly, “well, gentlemen, what\\'s the secret?”“i am longing,” answered benedick, “for your grace to command me totell.”“i charge you, then, on your allegiance to tell me,” said don pedro,falling in with his humor.“i can be as dumb as a mute,” apologized benedick to claudio, “but hisgrace commands my speech.” to don pedro he said, “claudio is in lovewith hero, leonato\\'s short daughter.”don pedro was pleased, for he admired hero and was fond of claudio. whenbenedick had departed, he said to claudio, “be steadfast in your lovefor hero, and i will help you to win her. to-night her father gives amasquerade, and i will pretend i am claudio, and tell her how claudioloves her, and if she be pleased, i will go to her father and ask hisconsent to your union.”most men like to do their own wooing, but if you fall in love with agovernor\\'s only daughter, you are fortunate if you can trust a prince toplead for you.claudio then was fortunate, but he was unfortunate as well, for hehad an enemy who was outwardly a friend. this enemy was don pedro\\'sstepbrother don john, who was jealous of claudio because don pedropreferred him to don john.it was to don john that borachio came with the interesting conversationwhich he had overheard.“i shall have some fun at that masquerade myself,” said don john whenborachio ceased speaking.on the night of the masquerade, don pedro, masked and pretending he wasclaudio, asked hero if he might walk with her.they moved away together, and don john went up to claudio and said,“signor benedick, i believe?” “the same,” fibbed claudio.“i should be much obliged then,” said don john, “if you would use yourinfluence with my brother to cure him of his love for hero. she isbeneath him in rank.”“how do you know he loves her?” inquired claudio.“i heard him swear his affection,” was the reply, and borachio chimed inwith, “so did i too.”claudio was then left to himself, and his thought was that his princehad betrayed him. “farewell, hero,” he muttered; “i was a fool to trustto an agent.”meanwhile beatrice and benedick (who was masked) were having a briskexchange of opinions.“did benedick ever make you laugh?” asked she.“who is benedick?” he inquired.“a prince\\'s jester,” replied beatrice, and she spoke so sharply that “iwould not marry her,” he declared afterwards, “if her estate were thegarden of eden.”but the principal speaker at the masquerade was neither beatrice norbenedick. it was don pedro, who carried out his plan to the letter, andbrought the light back to claudio\\'s face in a twinkling, by appearingbefore him with leonato and hero, and saying, “claudio, when would youlike to go to church?”“to-morrow,” was the prompt answer. “time goes on crutches till i marryhero.”“give her a week, my dear son,” said leonato, and claudio\\'s heartthumped with joy.“and now,” said the amiable don pedro, “we must find a wife for signorbenedick. it is a task for hercules.”“i will help you,” said leonato, “if i have to sit up ten nights.”then hero spoke. “i will do what i can, my lord, to find a good husbandfor beatrice.”thus, with happy laughter, ended the masquerade which had given claudioa lesson for nothing.borachio cheered up don john by laying a plan before him with which hewas confident he could persuade both claudio and don pedro that hero wasa fickle girl who had two strings to her bow. don john agreed to thisplan of hate.don pedro, on the other hand, had devised a cunning plan of love.“if,” he said to leonato, “we pretend, when beatrice is near enough tooverhear us, that benedick is pining for her love, she will pity him,see his good qualities, and love him. and if, when benedick thinks wedon\\'t know he is listening, we say how sad it is that the beautifulbeatrice should be in love with a heartless scoffer like benedick, hewill certainly be on his knees before her in a week or less.”so one day, when benedick was reading in a summer-house, claudio satdown outside it with leonato, and said, “your daughter told me somethingabout a letter she wrote.”“letter!” exclaimed leonato. “she will get up twenty times in the nightand write goodness knows what. but once hero peeped, and saw the words\\'benedick and beatrice\\' on the sheet, and then beatrice tore it up.”“hero told me,” said claudio, “that she cried, \\'o sweet benedick!\\'”benedick was touched to the core by this improbable story, which he wasvain enough to believe. “she is fair and good,” he said to himself.“i must not seem proud. i feel that i love her. people will laugh, ofcourse; but their paper bullets will do me no harm.”at this moment beatrice came to the summerhouse, and said, “against mywill, i have come to tell you that dinner is ready.”“fair beatrice, i thank you,” said benedick.“i took no more pains to come than you take pains to thank me,” was therejoinder, intended to freeze him.but it did not freeze him. it warmed him. the meaning he squeezed out ofher rude speech was that she was delighted to come to him.hero, who had undertaken the task of melting the heart of beatrice, tookno trouble to seek an occasion. she simply said to her maid margaret oneday, “run into the parlor and whisper to beatrice that ursula and i aretalking about her in the orchard.”having said this, she felt as sure that beatrice would overhear what wasmeant for her ears as if she had made an appointment with her cousin.in the orchard was a bower, screened from the sun by honeysuckles, andbeatrice entered it a few minutes after margaret had gone on her errand.“but are you sure,” asked ursula, who was one of hero\\'s attendants,“that benedick loves beatrice so devotedly?”“so say the prince and my betrothed,” replied hero, “and they wished meto tell her, but i said, \\'no! let benedick get over it.\\'”“why did you say that?”“because beatrice is unbearably proud. her eyes sparkle with disdain andscorn. she is too conceited to love. i should not like to see her makinggame of poor benedick\\'s love. i would rather see benedick waste awaylike a covered fire.”“i don\\'t agree with you,” said ursula. “i think your cousin is tooclear-sighted not to see the merits of benedick.” “he is the one man initaly, except claudio,” said hero.the talkers then left the orchard, and beatrice, excited and tender,stepped out of the summer-house, saying to herself, “poor dear benedick,be true to me, and your love shall tame this wild heart of mine.”we now return to the plan of hate.the night before the day fixed for claudio\\'s wedding, don john entereda room in which don pedro and claudio were conversing, and asked claudioif he intended to be married to-morrow.“you know he does!” said don pedro.“he may know differently,” said don john, “when he has seen what i willshow him if he will follow me.”they followed him into the garden; and they saw a lady leaning out ofhero\\'s window talking love to borachio.claudio thought the lady was hero, and said, “i will shame her for itto-morrow!” don pedro thought she was hero, too; but she was not hero;she was margaret.don john chuckled noiselessly when claudio and don pedro quitted thegarden; he gave borachio a purse containing a thousand ducats.the money made borachio feel very gay, and when he was walking in thestreet with his friend conrade, he boasted of his wealth and the giver,and told what he had done.a watchman overheard them, and thought that a man who had been paid athousand ducats for villainy was worth taking in charge. he thereforearrested borachio and conrade, who spent the rest of the night inprison.before noon of the next day half the aristocrats in messina were atchurch. hero thought it was her wedding day, and she was there in herwedding dress, no cloud on her pretty face or in her frank and shiningeyes.the priest was friar francis.turning to claudio, he said, “you come hither, my lord, to marry thislady?” “no!” contradicted claudio.leonato thought he was quibbling over grammar. “you should have said,friar,” said he, “\\'you come to be married to her.\\'”friar francis turned to hero. “lady,” he said, “you come hither to bemarried to this count?” “i do,” replied hero.“if either of you know any impediment to this marriage, i charge you toutter it,” said the friar.“do you know of any, hero?” asked claudio. “none,” said she.“know you of any, count?” demanded the friar. “i dare reply for him,\\'none,\\'” said leonato.claudio exclaimed bitterly, “o! what will not men dare say! father,” he continued, “will you give me your daughter?” “as freely,” repliedleonato, “as god gave her to me.”“and what can i give you,” asked claudio, “which is worthy of thisgift?” “nothing,” said don pedro, “unless you give the gift back to thegiver.”“sweet prince, you teach me,” said claudio. “there, leonato, take herback.”these brutal words were followed by others which flew from claudio, donpedro and don john.the church seemed no longer sacred. hero took her own part as long asshe could, then she swooned. all her persecutors left the church, excepther father, who was befooled by the accusations against her, and cried,“hence from her! let her die!”but friar francis saw hero blameless with his clear eyes that probed thesoul. “she is innocent,” he said; “a thousand signs have told me so.”hero revived under his kind gaze. her father, flurried and angry, knewnot what to think, and the friar said, “they have left her as one deadwith shame. let us pretend that she is dead until the truth is declared,and slander turns to remorse.”“the friar advises well,” said benedick. then hero was led away into aretreat, and beatrice and benedick remained alone in the church.benedick knew she had been weeping bitterly and long. “surely i dobelieve your fair cousin is wronged,” he said. she still wept.“is it not strange,” asked benedick, gently, “that i love nothing in theworld as well as you?”“it were as possible for me to say i loved nothing as well as you,” saidbeatrice, “but i do not say it. i am sorry for my cousin.”“tell me what to do for her,” said benedick. “kill claudio.”“ha! not for the wide world,” said benedick. “your refusal kills me,” said beatrice. “farewell.”“enough! i will challenge him,” cried benedick.during this scene borachio and conrade were in prison. there they wereexamined by a constable called dogberry.the watchman gave evidence to the effect that borachio had said that hehad received a thousand ducats for conspiring against hero.leonato was not present at this examination, but he was nevertheless nowthoroughly convinced of hero\\'s innocence. he played the part of bereavedfather very well, and when don pedro and claudio called on him in afriendly way, he said to the italian, “you have slandered my child todeath, and i challenge you to combat.”“i cannot fight an old man,” said claudio.“you could kill a girl,” sneered leonato, and claudio crimsoned.hot words grew from hot words, and both don pedro and claudio werefeeling scorched when leonato left the room and benedick entered.“the old man,” said claudio, “was like to have snapped my nose off.”“you are a villain!” said benedick, shortly. “fight me when and withwhat weapon you please, or i call you a coward.”claudio was astounded, but said, “i\\'ll meet you. nobody shall say ican\\'t carve a calf\\'s head.”benedick smiled, and as it was time for don pedro to receive officials,the prince sat down in a chair of state and prepared his mind forjustice.the door soon opened to admit dogberry and his prisoners.“what offence,” said don pedro, “are these men charged with?”borachio thought the moment a happy one for making a clean breast of it.he laid the whole blame on don john, who had disappeared. “the lady herobeing dead,” he said, “i desire nothing but the reward of a murderer.”claudio heard with anguish and deep repentance.upon the re-entrance of leonato be said to him, “this slave makes clearyour daughter\\'s innocence. choose your revenge.“leonato,” said don pedro, humbly, “i am ready for any penance you mayimpose.”“i ask you both, then,” said leonato, “to proclaim my daughter\\'sinnocence, and to honor her tomb by singing her praise before it. as foryou, claudio, i have this to say: my brother has a daughter so like herothat she might be a copy of her. marry her, and my vengeful feelingsdie.”“noble sir,” said claudio, “i am yours.” claudio then went to his roomand composed a solemn song. going to the church with don pedro and hisattendants, he sang it before the monument of leonato\\'s family. when hehad ended he said, “good night, hero. yearly will i do this.”he then gravely, as became a gentleman whose heart was hero\\'s, madeready to marry a girl whom he did not love. he was told to meet her inleonato\\'s house, and was faithful to his appointment.he was shown into a room where antonio (leonato\\'s brother) and severalmasked ladies entered after him. friar francis, leonato, and benedickwere present.antonio led one of the ladies towards claudio.“sweet,” said the young man, “let me see your face.”“swear first to marry her,” said leonato.“give me your hand,” said claudio to the lady; “before this holy friar iswear to marry you if you will be my wife.”“alive i was your wife,” said the lady, as she drew off her mask.“another hero!” exclaimed claudio.“hero died,” explained leonato, “only while slander lived.”the friar was then going to marry the reconciled pair, but benedickinterrupted him with, “softly, friar; which of these ladies isbeatrice?”hereat beatrice unmasked, and benedick said, “you love me, don\\'t you?”“only moderately,” was the reply. “do you love me?”“moderately,” answered benedick.“i was told you were well-nigh dead for me,” remarked beatrice.“of you i was told the same,” said benedick.“here\\'s your own hand in evidence of your love,” said claudio, producinga feeble sonnet which benedick had written to his sweetheart. “andhere,” said hero, “is a tribute to benedick, which i picked out of thepocket of beatrice.”“a miracle!” exclaimed benedick. “our hands are against our hearts!come, i will marry you, beatrice.”“you shall be my husband to save your life,” was the rejoinder.benedick kissed her on the mouth; and the friar married them after hehad married claudio and hero.“how is benedick the married man?” asked don pedro.“too happy to be made unhappy,” replied benedick. “crack what jokes youwill. as for you, claudio, i had hoped to run you through the body, butas you are now my kinsman, live whole and love my cousin.”“my cudgel was in love with you, benedick, until to-day,” said claudio;but, “come, come, let\\'s dance,” said benedick.and dance they did. not even the news of the capture of don john wasable to stop the flying feet of the happy lovers, for revenge is notsweet against an evil man who has failed to do harm.romeo and julietonce upon a time there lived in verona two great families named montaguand capulet. they were both rich, and i suppose they were as sensible,in most things, as other rich people. but in one thing they wereextremely silly. there was an old, old quarrel between the two families,and instead of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort ofpet of their quarrel, and would not let it die out. so that a montaguwouldn\\'t speak to a capulet if he met one in the street--nor a capuletto a montagu--or if they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasantthings, which often ended in a fight. and their relations andservants were just as foolish, so that street fights and duels anduncomfortablenesses of that kind were always growing out of themontagu-and-capulet quarrel.now lord capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supperand a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come toit except (of course) the montagues. but there was a young montagu namedromeo, who very much wanted to be there, because rosaline, the lady heloved, had been asked. this lady had never been at all kind to him, andhe had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to lovesomebody, and as he hadn\\'t seen the right lady, he was obliged to lovethe wrong one. so to the capulet\\'s grand party he came, with his friendsmercutio and benvolio.old capulet welcomed him and his two friends very kindly--and youngromeo moved about among the crowd of courtly folk dressed in theirvelvets and satins, the men with jeweled sword hilts and collars, andthe ladies with brilliant gems on breast and arms, and stones of priceset in their bright girdles. romeo was in his best too, and though hewore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone could see by hismouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he was twelvetimes handsomer than anyone else in the room.presently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovablethat from that moment he never again gave one thought to that rosalinewhom he had thought he loved. and he looked at this other fair lady, asshe moved in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the worldseemed vain and worthless to him compared with her. and he was sayingthis, or something like it, when tybalt, lady capulet\\'s nephew, hearinghis voice, knew him to be romeo. tybalt, being very angry, went atonce to his uncle, and told him how a montagu had come uninvited to thefeast; but old capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous toany man under his own roof, and he bade tybalt be quiet. but this youngman only waited for a chance to quarrel with romeo.in the meantime romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her insweet words that he loved her, and kissed her. just then her mother sentfor her, and then romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set hisheart\\'s hopes was juliet, the daughter of lord capulet, his sworn foe.so he went away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.then juliet said to her nurse:“who is that gentleman that would not dance?”“his name is romeo, and a montagu, the only son of your great enemy,” answered the nurse.then juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over thebeautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining. and romeo washidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to goright away without trying to see her again. so she--not knowing him tobe there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden howshe loved romeo.and romeo heard and was glad beyond measure. hidden below, he lookedup and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossomingcreepers that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, hefelt as though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by somemagician in that beautiful and enchanted garden.“ah--why are you called romeo?” said juliet. “since i love you, whatdoes it matter what you are called?”“call me but love, and i\\'ll be new baptized--henceforth i never will beromeo,” he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shadeof the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.she was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was romeo himself,and no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden belowand she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each onetrying to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasanttalk that lovers use. and the tale of all they said, and the sweet musictheir voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where youchildren may read it for yourselves some day.and the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each otherand are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as thoughthey had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.“i will send to you to-morrow,” said juliet.and so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.juliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window.romeo went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.the next morning, very early, romeo went to friar laurence, a priest,and, telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to julietwithout delay. and this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.so when juliet sent her old nurse to romeo that day to know what hepurposed to do, the old woman took back a a message that all was well,and all things ready for the marriage of juliet and romeo on the nextmorning.the young lovers were afraid to ask their parents\\' consent to theirmarriage, as young people should do, because of this foolish old quarrelbetween the capulets and the montagues.and friar laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly,because he thought that when they were once married their parentsmight soon be told, and that the match might put a happy end to the oldquarrel.so the next morning early, romeo and juliet were married at friarlaurence\\'s cell, and parted with tears and kisses. and romeo promised tocome into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladderto let down from the window, so that romeo could climb up and talk tohis dear wife quietly and alone.but that very day a dreadful thing happened.tybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at romeo\\'s going to thecapulet\\'s feast, met him and his two friends, mercutio and benvolio, inthe street, called romeo a villain, and asked him to fight. romeo had nowish to fight with juliet\\'s cousin, but mercutio drew his sword, andhe and tybalt fought. and mercutio was killed. when romeo saw that thisfriend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who hadkilled him, and he and tybalt fought till tybalt fell dead.so, on the very day of his wedding, romeo killed his dear juliet\\'scousin, and was sentenced to be banished. poor juliet and her younghusband met that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among theflowers, and found her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and theyparted with bitter tears and hearts heavy, because they could not knowwhen they should meet again.now juliet\\'s father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married,wished her to wed a gentleman named paris, and was so angry when sherefused, that she hurried away to ask friar laurence what she should do.he advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:“i will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for twodays, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, andnot to marry you. they will put you in the vault thinking you are dead,and before you wake up romeo and i will be there to take care of you.will you do this, or are you afraid?”“i will do it; talk not to me of fear!” said juliet. and she went homeand told her father she would marry paris. if she had spoken out andtold her father the truth . . . well, then this would have been adifferent story.lord capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set aboutinviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. everyonestayed up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very littletime to do it in. lord capulet was anxious to get juliet married becausehe saw she was very unhappy. of course she was really fretting about herhusband romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death ofher cousin tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something elseto think about.early in the morning the nurse came to call juliet, and to dress herfor her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried outsuddenly--“alas! alas! help! help! my lady\\'s dead! oh, well-a-day that ever i wasborn!”lady capulet came running in, and then lord capulet, and lord paris, thebridegroom. there lay juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all theirweeping could not wake her. so it was a burying that day instead of amarrying. meantime friar laurence had sent a messenger to mantua with aletter to romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have beenwell, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.but ill news travels fast. romeo\\'s servant who knew the secret of themarriage, but not of juliet\\'s pretended death, heard of her funeral, andhurried to mantua to tell romeo how his young wife was dead and lying inthe grave.“is it so?” cried romeo, heart-broken. “then i will lie by juliet\\'s sideto-night.”and he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to verona. hehastened to the tomb where juliet was lying. it was not a grave, but avault. he broke open the door, and was just going down the stone stepsthat led to the vault where all the dead capulets lay, when he heard avoice behind him calling on him to stop.it was the count paris, who was to have married juliet that very day.“how dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the capulets, youvile montagu?” cried paris.poor romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.“you were told,” said paris, “that if you returned to verona you mustdie.”“i must indeed,” said romeo. “i came here for nothing else. good, gentleyouth--leave me! oh, go--before i do you any harm! i love you betterthan myself--go--leave me here--”then paris said, “i defy you, and i arrest you as a felon,” and romeo,in his anger and despair, drew his sword. they fought, and paris waskilled.as romeo\\'s sword pierced him, paris cried--“oh, i am slain! if thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me withjuliet!”and romeo said, “in faith i will.”and he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dearjuliet\\'s side. then he kneeled by juliet and spoke to her, and heldher in his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead,while all the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of herawakening. then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart andwife.now came friar laurence when it was too late, and saw all that hadhappened--and then poor juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husbandand her friend both dead beside her.the noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, andfriar laurence, hearing them, ran away, and juliet was left alone. shesaw the cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, andsince no poison was left for her, she drew her romeo\\'s dagger and thrustit through her heart--and so, falling with her head on her romeo\\'sbreast, she died. and here ends the story of these faithful and mostunhappy lovers.            *    *    *    *    *    *    *and when the old folks knew from friar laurence of all that hadbefallen, they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischieftheir wicked quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over thebodies of their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendshipand forgiveness.periclespericles, the prince of tyre, was unfortunate enough to make an enemy ofantiochus, the powerful and wicked king of antioch; and so great was thedanger in which he stood that, on the advice of his trusty counselor,lord helicanus, he determined to travel about the world for a time. hecame to this decision despite the fact that, by the death of his father,he was now king of tyre. so he set sail for tarsus, appointing helicanusregent during his absence. that he did wisely in thus leaving hiskingdom was soon made clear.hardly had he sailed on his voyage, when lord thaliard arrived fromantioch with instructions from his royal master to kill pericles. thefaithful helicanus soon discovered the deadly purpose of this wickedlord, and at once sent messengers to tarsus to warn the king of thedanger which threatened him.the people of tarsus were in such poverty and distress that pericles,feeling that he could find no safe refuge there, put to sea again. buta dreadful storm overtook the ship in which he was, and the good vesselwas wrecked, while of all on board only pericles was saved. bruisedand wet and faint, he was flung upon the cruel rocks on the coast ofpentapolis, the country of the good king simonides. worn out as he was,he looked for nothing but death, and that speedily. but some fishermen,coming down to the beach, found him there, and gave him clothes and badehim be of good cheer.“thou shalt come home with me,” said one of them, “and we will haveflesh for holidays, fish for fasting days, and moreo\\'er, puddings andflapjacks, and thou shalt be welcome.”they told him that on the morrow many princes and knights were goingto the king\\'s court, there to joust and tourney for the love of hisdaughter, the beautiful princess thaisa.“did but my fortunes equal my desires,” said pericles, “i\\'d wish to makeone there.”as he spoke, some of the fishermen came by, drawing their net, and itdragged heavily, resisting all their efforts, but at last they hauled itin, to find that it contained a suit of rusty armor; and looking at it,he blessed fortune for her kindness, for he saw that it was his own,which had been given to him by his dead father. he begged the fishermento let him have it that he might go to court and take part in thetournament, promising that if ever his ill fortunes bettered, he wouldreward them well. the fishermen readily consented, and being thus fullyequipped, pericles set off in his rusty armor to the king\\'s court.in the tournament none bore himself so well as pericles, and he won thewreath of victory, which the fair princess herself placed on his brows.then at her father\\'s command she asked him who he was, and whence hecame; and he answered that he was a knight of tyre, by name pericles,but he did not tell her that he was the king of that country, for heknew that if once his whereabouts became known to antiochus, his lifewould not be worth a pin\\'s purchase.nevertheless thaisa loved him dearly, and the king was so pleased withhis courage and graceful bearing that he gladly permitted his daughterto have her own way, when she told him she would marry the strangerknight or die.thus pericles became the husband of the fair lady for whose sake hehad striven with the knights who came in all their bravery to joust andtourney for her love.meanwhile the wicked king antiochus had died, and the people in tyre,hearing no news of their king, urged lord helicanus to ascend the vacantthrone. but they could only get him to promise that he would becometheir king, if at the end of a year pericles did not come back.moreover, he sent forth messengers far and wide in search of the missingpericles.some of these made their way to pentapolis, and finding their kingthere, told him how discontented his people were at his long absence,and that, antiochus being dead, there was nothing now to hinder him fromreturning to his kingdom. then pericles told his wife and father-in-lawwho he really was, and they and all the subjects of simonides greatlyrejoiced to know that the gallant husband of thaisa was a king in hisown right. so pericles set sail with his dear wife for his native land.but once more the sea was cruel to him, for again a dreadful storm brokeout, and while it was at its height, a servant came to tell him thata little daughter was born to him. this news would have made his heartglad indeed, but that the servant went on to add that his wife--hisdear, dear thaisa--was dead.while he was praying the gods to be good to his little baby girl,the sailors came to him, declaring that the dead queen must be thrownoverboard, for they believed that the storm would never cease so longas a dead body remained in the vessel. so thaisa was laid in a big chestwith spices and jewels, and a scroll on which the sorrowful king wrotethese lines:   “here i give to understand    (if e\\'er this coffin drive a-land),    i, king pericles, have lost    this queen worth all our mundane cost.    who finds her, give her burying;    she was the daughter of a king;    besides this treasure for a fee,    the gods requite his charity!”then the chest was cast into the sea, and the waves taking it, by andby washed it ashore at ephesus, where it was found by the servants of alord named cerimon. he at once ordered it to be opened, and when hesaw how lovely thaisa looked, he doubted if she were dead, and tookimmediate steps to restore her. then a great wonder happened, for she,who had been thrown into the sea as dead, came back to life. but feelingsure that she would never see her husband again, thaisa retired from theworld, and became a priestess of the goddess diana.while these things were happening, pericles went on to tarsus with hislittle daughter, whom he called marina, because she had been born atsea. leaving her in the hands of his old friend the governor of tarsus,the king sailed for his own dominions.now dionyza, the wife of the governor of tarsus, was a jealous andwicked woman, and finding that the young princess grew up a moreaccomplished and charming girl than her own daughter, she determined totake marina\\'s life. so when marina was fourteen, dionyza ordered one ofher servants to take her away and kill her. this villain would have doneso, but that he was interrupted by some pirates who came in and carriedmarina off to sea with them, and took her to mitylene, where they soldher as a slave. yet such was her goodness, her grace, and her beauty,that she soon became honored there, and lysimachus, the young governor,fell deep in love with her, and would have married her, but that hethought she must be of too humble parentage to become the wife of one inhis high position.the wicked dionyza believed, from her servant\\'s report, that marina wasreally dead, and so she put up a monument to her memory, and showed itto king pericles, when after long years of absence he came to seehis much-loved child. when he heard that she was dead, his grief wasterrible to see. he set sail once more, and putting on sackcloth, vowednever to wash his face or cut his hair again. there was a pavilionerected on deck, and there he lay alone, and for three months he spokeword to none.at last it chanced that his ship came into the port of mitylene, andlysimachus, the governor, went on board to enquire whence the vesselcame. when he heard the story of pericles\\' sorrow and silence, hebethought him of marina, and believing that she could rouse the kingfrom his stupor, sent for her and bade her try her utmost to persuadethe king to speak, promising whatever reward she would, if shesucceeded. marina gladly obeyed, and sending the rest away, she sat andsang to her poor grief-laden father, yet, sweet as was her voice, hemade no sign. so presently she spoke to him, saying that her grief mightequal his, for, though she was a slave, she came from ancestors thatstood equal to mighty kings.something in her voice and story touched the king\\'s heart, and he lookedup at her, and as he looked, he saw with wonder how like she was to hislost wife, so with a great hope springing up in his heart, he bade hertell her story.then, with many interruptions from the king, she told him who she wasand how she had escaped from the cruel dionyza. so pericles knew thatthis was indeed his daughter, and he kissed her again and again, cryingthat his great seas of joy drowned him with their sweetness. “give me myrobes,” he said: “o heaven, bless my girl!”then there came to him, though none else could hear it, the sound ofheavenly music, and falling asleep, he beheld the goddess diana, in avision.“go,” she said to him, “to my temple at ephesus, and when my maidenpriests are met together, reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.”pericles obeyed the goddess and told his tale before her altar. hardlyhad he made an end, when the chief priestess, crying out, “you are--youare--o royal pericles!” fell fainting to the ground, and presentlyrecovering, she spoke again to him, “o my lord, are you not pericles?” “the voice of dead thaisa!” exclaimed the king in wonder. “that thaisaam i,” she said, and looking at her he saw that she spoke the verytruth.thus pericles and thaisa, after long and bitter suffering, foundhappiness once more, and in the joy of their meeting they forgot thepain of the past. to marina great happiness was given, and not onlyin being restored to her dear parents; for she married lysimachus, andbecame a princess in the land where she had been sold as a slave.hamlethamlet was the only son of the king of denmark. he loved his father andmother dearly--and was happy in the love of a sweet lady named ophelia.her father, polonius, was the king\\'s chamberlain.while hamlet was away studying at wittenberg, his father died. younghamlet hastened home in great grief to hear that a serpent had stungthe king, and that he was dead. the young prince had loved his father sotenderly that you may judge what he felt when he found that the queen,before yet the king had been laid in the ground a month, had determinedto marry again--and to marry the dead king\\'s brother.hamlet refused to put off mourning for the wedding.“it is not only the black i wear on my body,” he said, “that proves myloss. i wear mourning in my heart for my dead father. his son at leastremembers him, and grieves still.”then said claudius the king\\'s brother, “this grief is unreasonable. ofcourse you must sorrow at the loss of your father, but--”“ah,” said hamlet, bitterly, “i cannot in one little month forget thosei love.”with that the queen and claudius left him, to make merry over theirwedding, forgetting the poor good king who had been so kind to themboth.and hamlet, left alone, began to wonder and to question as to what heought to do. for he could not believe the story about the snake-bite.it seemed to him all too plain that the wicked claudius had killed theking, so as to get the crown and marry the queen. yet he had no proof,and could not accuse claudius.and while he was thus thinking came horatio, a fellow student of his,from wittenberg.“what brought you here?” asked hamlet, when he had greeted his friendkindly.“i came, my lord, to see your father\\'s funeral.”“i think it was to see my mother\\'s wedding,” said hamlet, bitterly. “myfather! we shall not look upon his like again.”“my lord,” answered horatio, “i think i saw him yesternight.”then, while hamlet listened in surprise, horatio told how he, with twogentlemen of the guard, had seen the king\\'s ghost on the battlements.hamlet went that night, and true enough, at midnight, the ghost of theking, in the armor he had been wont to wear, appeared on the battlementsin the chill moonlight. hamlet was a brave youth. instead of runningaway from the ghost he spoke to it--and when it beckoned him he followedit to a quiet place, and there the ghost told him that what he hadsuspected was true. the wicked claudius had indeed killed his goodbrother the king, by dropping poison into his ear as he slept in hisorchard in the afternoon.“and you,” said the ghost, “must avenge this cruel murder-- on my wickedbrother. but do nothing against the queen-- for i have loved her, andshe is your mother. remember me.”then seeing the morning approach, the ghost vanished.“now,” said hamlet, “there is nothing left but revenge. remember thee--iwill remember nothing else--books, pleasure, youth--let all go--and yourcommands alone live on my brain.”so when his friends came back he made them swear to keep the secret ofthe ghost, and then went in from the battlements, now gray with mingleddawn and moonlight, to think how he might best avenge his murderedfather.the shock of seeing and hearing his father\\'s ghost made him feel almostmad, and for fear that his uncle might notice that he was not himself,he determined to hide his mad longing for revenge under a pretendedmadness in other matters.and when he met ophelia, who loved him--and to whom he had given gifts,and letters, and many loving words--he behaved so wildly to her, thatshe could not but think him mad. for she loved him so that she could notbelieve he would be as cruel as this, unless he were quite mad. so shetold her father, and showed him a pretty letter from hamlet. and in theletter was much folly, and this pretty verse--       “doubt that the stars are fire;          doubt that the sun doth move;        doubt truth to be a liar;          but never doubt i love.”and from that time everyone believed that the cause of hamlet\\'s supposedmadness was love.poor hamlet was very unhappy. he longed to obey his father\\'s ghost--andyet he was too gentle and kindly to wish to kill another man, even hisfather\\'s murderer. and sometimes he wondered whether, after all, theghost spoke truly.just at this time some actors came to the court, and hamlet ordered themto perform a certain play before the king and queen. now, this playwas the story of a man who had been murdered in his garden by a nearrelation, who afterwards married the dead man\\'s wife.you may imagine the feelings of the wicked king, as he sat on histhrone, with the queen beside him and all his court around, and saw,acted on the stage, the very wickedness that he had himself done. andwhen, in the play, the wicked relation poured poison into the ear of thesleeping man, the wicked claudius suddenly rose, and staggered from theroom--the queen and others following.then said hamlet to his friends--“now i am sure the ghost spoke true. for if claudius had not done thismurder, he could not have been so distressed to see it in a play.”now the queen sent for hamlet, by the king\\'s desire, to scold himfor his conduct during the play, and for other matters; and claudius,wishing to know exactly what happened, told old polonius to hide himselfbehind the hangings in the queen\\'s room. and as they talked, the queengot frightened at hamlet\\'s rough, strange words, and cried for help, andpolonius behind the curtain cried out too. hamlet, thinking it was theking who was hidden there, thrust with his sword at the hangings, andkilled, not the king, but poor old polonius.so now hamlet had offended his uncle and his mother, and by bad hapkilled his true love\\'s father.“oh! what a rash and bloody deed is this,” cried the queen.and hamlet answered bitterly, “almost as bad as to kill a king, andmarry his brother.” then hamlet told the queen plainly all his thoughtsand how he knew of the murder, and begged her, at least, to have no morefriendship or kindness of the base claudius, who had killed the goodking. and as they spoke the king\\'s ghost again appeared before hamlet,but the queen could not see it. so when the ghost had gone, they parted.when the queen told claudius what had passed, and how polonius was dead,he said, “this shows plainly that hamlet is mad, and since he has killedthe chancellor, it is for his own safety that we must carry out ourplan, and send him away to england.”so hamlet was sent, under charge of two courtiers who served the king,and these bore letters to the english court, requiring that hamletshould be put to death. but hamlet had the good sense to get at theseletters, and put in others instead, with the names of the two courtierswho were so ready to betray him. then, as the vessel went to england,hamlet escaped on board a pirate ship, and the two wicked courtiers lefthim to his fate, and went on to meet theirs.hamlet hurried home, but in the meantime a dreadful thing had happened.poor pretty ophelia, having lost her lover and her father, lost her witstoo, and went in sad madness about the court, with straws, and weeds,and flowers in her hair, singing strange scraps of songs, and talkingpoor, foolish, pretty talk with no heart of meaning to it. and oneday, coming to a stream where willows grew, she tried to bang a flowerygarland on a willow, and fell into the water with all her flowers, andso died.and hamlet had loved her, though his plan of seeming madness had madehim hide it; and when he came back, he found the king and queen, and thecourt, weeping at the funeral of his dear love and lady.ophelia\\'s brother, laertes, had also just come to court to ask justicefor the death of his father, old polonius; and now, wild with grief, heleaped into his sister\\'s grave, to clasp her in his arms once more.“i loved her more than forty thousand brothers,” cried hamlet, and leaptinto the grave after him, and they fought till they were parted.afterwards hamlet begged laertes to forgive him.“i could not bear,” he said, “that any, even a brother, should seem tolove her more than i.”but the wicked claudius would not let them be friends. he told laerteshow hamlet had killed old polonius, and between them they made a plot toslay hamlet by treachery.laertes challenged him to a fencing match, and all the court werepresent. hamlet had the blunt foil always used in fencing, but laerteshad prepared for himself a sword, sharp, and tipped with poison. and thewicked king had made ready a bowl of poisoned wine, which he meantto give poor hamlet when he should grow warm with the sword play, andshould call for drink.so laertes and hamlet fought, and laertes, after some fencing, gavehamlet a sharp sword thrust. hamlet, angry at this treachery--forthey had been fencing, not as men fight, but as they play--closed withlaertes in a struggle; both dropped their swords, and when they pickedthem up again, hamlet, without noticing it, had exchanged his own bluntsword for laertes\\' sharp and poisoned one. and with one thrust of it hepierced laertes, who fell dead by his own treachery.at this moment the queen cried out, “the drink, the drink! oh, my dearhamlet! i am poisoned!”she had drunk of the poisoned bowl the king had prepared for hamlet, andthe king saw the queen, whom, wicked as he was, he really loved, falldead by his means.then ophelia being dead, and polonius, and the queen, and laertes, andthe two courtiers who had been sent to england, hamlet at last foundcourage to do the ghost\\'s bidding and avenge his father\\'s murder--which,if he had braced up his heart to do long before, all these liveshad been spared, and none had suffered but the wicked king, who welldeserved to die.hamlet, his heart at last being great enough to do the deed he ought,turned the poisoned sword on the false king.“then--venom--do thy work!” he cried, and the king died.so hamlet in the end kept the promise he had made his father. and allbeing now accomplished, he himself died. and those who stood by saw himdie, with prayers and tears, for his friends and his people loved himwith their whole hearts. thus ends the tragic tale of hamlet, prince ofdenmark.cymbelinecymbeline was the king of britain. he had three children. the two sonswere stolen away from him when they were quite little children, and hewas left with only one daughter, imogen. the king married a secondtime, and brought up leonatus, the son of a dear friend, as imogen\\'splayfellow; and when leonatus was old enough, imogen secretly marriedhim. this made the king and queen very angry, and the king, to punishleonatus, banished him from britain.poor imogen was nearly heart-broken at parting from leonatus, and he wasnot less unhappy. for they were not only lovers and husband and wife,but they had been friends and comrades ever since they were quite littlechildren. with many tears and kisses they said “good-bye.” they promisednever to forget each other, and that they would never care for anyoneelse as long as they lived.“this diamond was my mother\\'s, love,” said imogen; “take it, my heart,and keep it as long as you love me.”“sweetest, fairest,” answered leonatus, “wear this bracelet for mysake.”“ah!” cried imogen, weeping, “when shall we meet again?”and while they were still in each other\\'s arms, the king came in, andleonatus had to leave without more farewell.when he was come to rome, where he had gone to stay with an old friendof his father\\'s, he spent his days still in thinking of his dear imogen,and his nights in dreaming of her. one day at a feast some italian andfrench noblemen were talking of their sweethearts, and swearing thatthey were the most faithful and honorable and beautiful ladies in theworld. and a frenchman reminded leonatus how he had said many times thathis wife imogen was more fair, wise, and constant than any of the ladiesin france.“i say so still,” said leonatus.“she is not so good but that she would deceive,” said iachimo, one ofthe italian nobles.“she never would deceive,” said leonatus.“i wager,” said iachimo, “that, if i go to britain, i can persuade yourwife to do whatever i wish, even if it should be against your wishes.”“that you will never do,” said leonatus. “i wager this ring upon myfinger,” which was the very ring imogen had given him at parting, “thatmy wife will keep all her vows to me, and that you will never persuadeher to do otherwise.”so iachimo wagered half his estate against the ring on leonatus\\'sfinger, and started forthwith for britain, with a letter of introductionto leonatus\\'s wife. when he reached there he was received with allkindness; but he was still determined to win his wager.he told imogen that her husband thought no more of her, and went on totell many cruel lies about him. imogen listened at first, but presentlyperceived what a wicked person iachimo was, and ordered him to leaveher. then he said--“pardon me, fair lady, all that i have said is untrue. i only told youthis to see whether you would believe me, or whether you were as much tobe trusted as your husband thinks. will you forgive me?”“i forgive you freely,” said imogen.“then,” went on iachimo, “perhaps you will prove it by taking charge ofa trunk, containing a number of jewels which your husband and i and someother gentlemen have bought as a present for the emperor of rome.”“i will indeed,” said imogen, “do anything for my husband and a friendof my husband\\'s. have the jewels sent into my room, and i will take careof them.”“it is only for one night,” said iachimo, “for i leave britain againto-morrow.”so the trunk was carried into imogen\\'s room, and that night she went tobed and to sleep. when she was fast asleep, the lid of the trunk openedand a man got out. it was iachimo. the story about the jewels was asuntrue as the rest of the things he had said. he had only wished to getinto her room to win his wicked wager. he looked about him and noticedthe furniture, and then crept to the side of the bed where imogenwas asleep and took from her arm the gold bracelet which had been theparting gift of her husband. then he crept back to the trunk, and nextmorning sailed for rome.when he met leonatus, he said--“i have been to britain and i have won the wager, for your wife nolonger thinks about you. she stayed talking with me all one night in herroom, which is hung with tapestry and has a carved chimney-piece, andsilver andirons in the shape of two winking cupids.”“i do not believe she has forgotten me; i do not believe she stayedtalking with you in her room. you have heard her room described by theservants.”“ah!” said iachimo, “but she gave me this bracelet. she took it fromher arm. i see her yet. her pretty action did outsell her gift, and yetenriched it too. she gave it me, and said she prized it once.”“take the ring,” cried leonatus, “you have won; and you might havewon my life as well, for i care nothing for it now i know my lady hasforgotten me.”and mad with anger, he wrote letters to britain to his old servant,pisanio, ordering him to take imogen to milford haven, and to murderher, because she had forgotten him and given away his gift. at the sametime he wrote to imogen herself, telling her to go with pisanio, his oldservant, to milford haven, and that he, her husband, would be there tomeet her.now when pisanio got this letter he was too good to carry out itsorders, and too wise to let them alone altogether. so he gave imogen theletter from her husband, and started with her for milford haven. beforehe left, the wicked queen gave him a drink which, she said, would beuseful in sickness. she hoped he would give it to imogen, and thatimogen would die, and the wicked queen\\'s son could be king. for thequeen thought this drink was a poison, but really and truly it was onlya sleeping-draft.when pisanio and imogen came near to milford haven, he told her what wasreally in the letter he had had from her husband.“i must go on to rome, and see him myself,” said imogen.and then pisanio helped her to dress in boy\\'s clothes, and sent heron her way, and went back to the court. before he went he gave her thedrink he had had from the queen.imogen went on, getting more and more tired, and at last came to a cave.someone seemed to live there, but no one was in just then. so she wentin, and as she was almost dying of hunger, she took some food she sawthere, and had just done so, when an old man and two boys came into thecave. she was very much frightened when she saw them, for she thoughtthat they would be angry with her for taking their food, though shehad meant to leave money for it on the table. but to her surprise theywelcomed her kindly. she looked very pretty in her boy\\'s clothes and herface was good, as well as pretty.“you shall be our brother,” said both the boys; and so she stayed withthem, and helped to cook the food, and make things comfortable. but oneday when the old man, whose name was bellarius, was out hunting withthe two boys, imogen felt ill, and thought she would try the medicinepisanio had given her. so she took it, and at once became like a deadcreature, so that when bellarius and the boys came back from hunting,they thought she was dead, and with many tears and funeral songs, theycarried her away and laid her in the wood, covered with flowers.they sang sweet songs to her, and strewed flowers on her, paleprimroses, and the azure harebell, and eglantine, and furred moss, andwent away sorrowful. no sooner had they gone than imogen awoke, and notknowing how she came there, nor where she was, went wandering throughthe wood.now while imogen had been living in the cave, the romans had decided toattack britain, and their army had come over, and with them leonatus,who had grown sorry for his wickedness against imogen, so had comeback, not to fight with the romans against britain, but with the britonsagainst rome. so as imogen wandered alone, she met with lucius, theroman general, and took service with him as his page.when the battle was fought between the romans and britons, bellarius andhis two boys fought for their own country, and leonatus, disguised asa british peasant, fought beside them. the romans had taken cymbelineprisoner, and old bellarius, with his sons and leonatus, bravely rescuedthe king. then the britons won the battle, and among the prisonersbrought before the king were lucius, with imogen, iachimo, and leonatus,who had put on the uniform of a roman soldier. he was tired of his lifesince he had cruelly ordered his wife to be killed, and he hoped that,as a roman soldier, he would be put to death.when they were brought before the king, lucius spoke out--“a roman with a roman\\'s heart can suffer,” he said. “if i must die, sobe it. this one thing only will i entreat. my boy, a briton born, lethim be ransomed. never master had a page so kind, so duteous, diligent,true. he has done no briton harm, though he has served a roman. savehim, sir.”then cymbeline looked on the page, who was his own daughter, imogen, indisguise, and though he did not recognize her, he felt such a kindnessthat he not only spared the boy\\'s life, but he said--“he shall have any boon he likes to ask of me, even though he ask aprisoner, the noblest taken.”then imogen said, “the boon i ask is that this gentleman shall say fromwhom he got the ring he has on his finger,” and she pointed to iachimo.“speak,” said cymbeline, “how did you get that diamond?”then iachimo told the whole truth of his villainy. at this, leonatus wasunable to contain himself, and casting aside all thought of disguise, hecame forward, cursing himself for his folly in having believed iachimo\\'slying story, and calling again and again on his wife whom he believeddead.“oh, imogen, my love, my life!” he cried. “oh, imogen!then imogen, forgetting she was disguised, cried out, “peace, mylord--here, here!”leonatus turned to strike the forward page who thus interfered in hisgreat trouble, and then he saw that it was his wife, imogen, and theyfell into each other\\'s arms.the king was so glad to see his dear daughter again, and so grateful tothe man who had rescued him (whom he now found to be leonatus), that hegave his blessing on their marriage, and then he turned to bellarius,and the two boys. now bellarius spoke--“i am your old servant, bellarius. you accused me of treason when i hadonly been loyal to you, and to be doubted, made me disloyal. so i stoleyour two sons, and see,--they are here!” and he brought forward the twoboys, who had sworn to be brothers to imogen when they thought she was aboy like themselves.the wicked queen was dead of some of her own poisons, and the king, withhis three children about him, lived to a happy old age.so the wicked were punished, and the good and true lived happy everafter. so may the wicked suffer, and honest folk prosper till theworld\\'s end.macbethwhen a person is asked to tell the story of macbeth, he can tell twostories. one is of a man called macbeth who came to the throne ofscotland by a crime in the year of our lord 1039, and reigned justlyand well, on the whole, for fifteen years or more. this story is partof scottish history. the other story issues from a place calledimagination; it is gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.a year or two before edward the confessor began to rule england, abattle was won in scotland against a norwegian king by two generalsnamed macbeth and banquo. after the battle, the generals walked togethertowards forres, in elginshire, where duncan, king of scotland, wasawaiting them.while they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women,sisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.“speak, who are you?” demanded macbeth.“hail, macbeth, chieftain of glamis,” said the first woman.“hail, macbeth, chieftain of cawdor,” said the second woman.“hail, macbeth, king that is to be,” said the third woman.then banquo asked, “what of me?” and the third woman replied, “thoushalt be the father of kings.”“tell me more,” said macbeth. “by my father\\'s death i am chieftain ofglamis, but the chieftain of cawdor lives, and the king lives, and hischildren live. speak, i charge you!”the women replied only by vanishing, as though suddenly mixed with theair.banquo and macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches,and were discussing their prophecies when two nobles approached. one ofthem thanked macbeth, in the king\\'s name, for his military services, andthe other said, “he bade me call you chieftain of cawdor.”macbeth then learned that the man who had yesterday borne that titlewas to die for treason, and he could not help thinking, “the third witchcalled me, \\'king that is to be.\\'”“banquo,” he said, “you see that the witches spoke truth concerning me.do you not believe, therefore, that your child and grandchild will bekings?”banquo frowned. duncan had two sons, malcolm and donalbain, and hedeemed it disloyal to hope that his son fleance should rule scotland.he told macbeth that the witches might have intended to tempt themboth into villainy by their prophecies concerning the throne. macbeth,however, thought the prophecy that he should be king too pleasant tokeep to himself, and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter.lady macbeth was the grand-daughter of a king of scotland who had diedin defending his crown against the king who preceded duncan, and bywhose order her only brother was slain. to her, duncan was a reminderof bitter wrongs. her husband had royal blood in his veins, and when sheread his letter, she was determined that he should be king.when a messenger arrived to inform her that duncan would pass a night inmacbeth\\'s castle, she nerved herself for a very base action.she told macbeth almost as soon as she saw him that duncan must spenda sunless morrow. she meant that duncan must die, and that the dead areblind. “we will speak further,” said macbeth uneasily, and at night,with his memory full of duncan\\'s kind words, he would fain have sparedhis guest.“would you live a coward?” demanded lady macbeth, who seems to havethought that morality and cowardice were the same.“i dare do all that may become a man,” replied macbeth; “who dare domore is none.”“why did you write that letter to me?” she inquired fiercely, and withbitter words she egged him on to murder, and with cunning words sheshowed him how to do it.after supper duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard athis bedroom door. lady macbeth caused them to drink wine till they werestupefied. she then took their daggers and would have killed the kingherself if his sleeping face had not looked like her father\\'s.macbeth came later, and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soonwith red hands he appeared before his wife, saying, “methought i heard avoice cry, \\'sleep no more! macbeth destroys the sleeping.\\'”“wash your hands,” said she. “why did you not leave the daggers by thegrooms? take them back, and smear the grooms with blood.”“i dare not,” said macbeth.his wife dared, and she returned to him with hands red as his own, but aheart less white, she proudly told him, for she scorned his fear.the murderers heard a knocking, and macbeth wished it was a knockingwhich could wake the dead. it was the knocking of macduff, the chieftainof fife, who had been told by duncan to visit him early. macbeth went tohim, and showed him the door of the king\\'s room.macduff entered, and came out again crying, “o horror! horror! horror!”macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as macduff, and pretending that hecould not bear to see life in duncan\\'s murderers, he slew the two groomswith their own daggers before they could proclaim their innocence.these murders did not shriek out, and macbeth was crowned at scone.one of duncan\\'s sons went to ireland, the other to england. macbeth wasking. but he was discontented. the prophecy concerning banquo oppressedhis mind. if fleance were to rule, a son of macbeth would not rule.macbeth determined, therefore, to murder both banquo and his son. hehired two ruffians, who slew banquo one night when he was on his waywith fleance to a banquet which macbeth was giving to his nobles.fleance escaped.meanwhile macbeth and his queen received their guests very graciously,and he expressed a wish for them which has been uttered thousands oftimes since his day--“now good digestion wait on appetite, and health onboth.”“we pray your majesty to sit with us,” said lennox, a scotch noble; butere macbeth could reply, the ghost of banquo entered the banqueting halland sat in macbeth\\'s place.not noticing the ghost, macbeth observed that, if banquo were present,he could say that he had collected under his roof the choicest chivalryof scotland. macduff, however, had curtly declined his invitation.the king was again pressed to take a seat, and lennox, to whom banquo\\'sghost was invisible, showed him the chair where it sat.but macbeth, with his eyes of genius, saw the ghost. he saw it like aform of mist and blood, and he demanded passionately, “which of you havedone this?”still none saw the ghost but he, and to the ghost macbeth said, “thoucanst not say i did it.”the ghost glided out, and macbeth was impudent enough to raise a glassof wine “to the general joy of the whole table, and to our dear friendbanquo, whom we miss.”the toast was drunk as the ghost of banquo entered for the second time.“begone!” cried macbeth. “you are senseless, mindless! hide in theearth, thou horrible shadow.”again none saw the ghost but he.“what is it your majesty sees?” asked one of the nobles.the queen dared not permit an answer to be given to this question. shehurriedly begged her guests to quit a sick man who was likely to growworse if he was obliged to talk.macbeth, however, was well enough next day to converse with the witcheswhose prophecies had so depraved him.he found them in a cavern on a thunderous day. they were revolving rounda cauldron in which were boiling particles of many strange and horriblecreatures, and they knew he was coming before he arrived.“answer me what i ask you,” said the king.“would you rather hear it from us or our masters?” asked the firstwitch.“call them,” replied macbeth.thereupon the witches poured blood into the cauldron and grease into theflame that licked it, and a helmeted head appeared with the visor on, sothat macbeth could only see its eyes.he was speaking to the head, when the first witch said gravely, “heknows thy thought,” and a voice in the head said, “macbeth, bewaremacduff, the chieftain of fife.” the head then descended into thecauldron till it disappeared.“one word more,” pleaded macbeth.“he will not be commanded,” said the first witch, and then a crownedchild ascended from the cauldron bearing a tree in his hand the childsaid--    “macbeth shall be unconquerable till     the wood of birnam climbs dunsinane hill.”“that will never be,” said macbeth; and he asked to be told if banquo\\'sdescendants would ever rule scotland.the cauldron sank into the earth; music was heard, and a procession ofphantom kings filed past macbeth; behind them was banquo\\'s ghost. ineach king, macbeth saw a likeness to banquo, and he counted eight kings.then he was suddenly left alone.his next proceeding was to send murderers to macduff\\'s castle. theydid not find macduff, and asked lady macduff where he was. she gavea stinging answer, and her questioner called macduff a traitor. “thouliest!” shouted macduff\\'s little son, who was immediately stabbed, andwith his last breath entreated his mother to fly. the murderers did notleave the castle while one of its inmates remained alive.macduff was in england listening, with malcolm, to a doctor\\'s tale ofcures wrought by edward the confessor when his friend ross came to tellhim that his wife and children were no more. at first ross dared notspeak the truth, and turn macduff\\'s bright sympathy with sufferersrelieved by royal virtue into sorrow and hatred. but when malcolm saidthat england was sending an army into scotland against macbeth, rossblurted out his news, and macduff cried, “all dead, did you say? all mypretty ones and their mother? did you say all?”his sorry hope was in revenge, but if he could have looked intomacbeth\\'s castle on dunsinane hill, he would have seen at work a forcemore solemn than revenge. retribution was working, for lady macbeth wasmad. she walked in her sleep amid ghastly dreams. she was wont to washher hands for a quarter of an hour at a time; but after all her washing,would still see a red spot of blood upon her skin. it was pitiful tohear her cry that all the perfumes of arabia could not sweeten herlittle hand.“canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?” inquired macbeth of thedoctor, but the doctor replied that his patient must minister to her ownmind. this reply gave macbeth a scorn of medicine. “throw physic to thedogs,” he said; “i\\'ll none of it.”one day he heard a sound of women crying. an officer approached him andsaid, “the queen, your majesty, is dead.” “out, brief candle,” mutteredmacbeth, meaning that life was like a candle, at the mercy of a puff ofair. he did not weep; he was too familiar with death.presently a messenger told him that he saw birnam wood on the march.macbeth called him a liar and a slave, and threatened to hang him if hehad made a mistake. “if you are right you can hang me,” he said.from the turret windows of dunsinane castle, birnam wood did indeedappear to be marching. every soldier of the english army held aloft abough which he had cut from a tree in that wood, and like human treesthey climbed dunsinane hill.macbeth had still his courage. he went to battle to conquer or die, andthe first thing he did was to kill the english general\\'s son in singlecombat. macbeth then felt that no man could fight him and live, and whenmacduff came to him blazing for revenge, macbeth said to him, “go back;i have spilt too much of your blood already.”“my voice is in my sword,” replied macduff, and hacked at him and badehim yield.“i will not yield!” said macbeth, but his last hour had struck. he fell.macbeth\\'s men were in retreat when macduff came before malcolm holding aking\\'s head by the hair.“hail, king!” he said; and the new king looked at the old.so malcolm reigned after macbeth; but in years that came afterwards thedescendants of banquo were kings.the comedy of errorsaegeon was a merchant of syracuse, which is a seaport in sicily. hiswife was aemilia, and they were very happy until aegeon\\'s manager died,and he was obliged to go by himself to a place called epidamnum on theadriatic. as soon as she could aemilia followed him, and after they hadbeen together some time two baby boys were born to them. the babies wereexactly alike; even when they were dressed differently they looked thesame.and now you must believe a very strange thing. at the same inn wherethese children were born, and on the same day, two baby boys were bornto a much poorer couple than aemilia and aegeon; so poor, indeed, werethe parents of these twins that they sold them to the parents of theother twins.aemilia was eager to show her children to her friends in syracuse,and in treacherous weather she and aegeon and the four babies sailedhomewards.they were still far from syracuse when their ship sprang a leak, and thecrew left it in a body by the only boat, caring little what became oftheir passengers.aemilia fastened one of her children to a mast and tied one of theslave-children to him; aegeon followed her example with the remainingchildren. then the parents secured themselves to the same masts, andhoped for safety.the ship, however, suddenly struck a rock and was split in two, andaemilia, and the two children whom she had tied, floated away fromaegeon and the other children. aemilia and her charges were picked up bysome people of epidamnum, but some fishermen of corinth took thebabies from her by force, and she returned to epidanmum alone, and verymiserable. afterwards she settled in ephesus, a famous town in asiaminor.aegeon and his charges were also saved; and, more fortunate thanaemilia, he was able to return to syracuse and keep them till they wereeighteen. his own child he called antipholus, and the slavechild hecalled dromio; and, strangely enough, these were the names given to thechildren who floated away from him.at the age of eighteen the son who was with aegeon grew restless with adesire to find his brother. aegeon let him depart with his servant, andthe young men are henceforth known as antipholus of syracuse and dromioof syracuse.let alone, aegeon found his home too dreary to dwell in, and traveledfor five years. he did not, during his absence, learn all the news ofsyracuse, or he would never have gone to ephesus.as it was, his melancholy wandering ceased in that town, where he wasarrested almost as soon as he arrived. he then found that the duke ofsyracuse had been acting in so tyrannical a manner to ephesians unluckyenough to fall into his hands, that the government of ephesus hadangrily passed a law which punished by death or a fine of a thousandpounds any syracusan who should come to ephesus. aegeon was broughtbefore solinus, duke of ephesus, who told him that he must die or pay athousand pounds before the end of the day.you will think there was fate in this when i tell you that the childrenwho were kidnaped by the fishermen of corinth were now citizens ofephesus, whither they had been brought by duke menaphon, an uncle ofduke solinus. they will henceforth be called antipholus of ephesus anddromio of ephesus.moreover, on the very day when aegeon was arrested, antipholus ofsyracuse landed in ephesus and pretended that he came from epidamnum inorder to avoid a penalty. he handed his money to his servant dromio ofsyracuse, and bade him take it to the centaur inn and remain there tillhe came.in less than ten minutes he was met on the mart by dromio of ephesus,his brother\\'s slave, and immediately mistook him for his own dromio.“why are you back so soon? where did you leave the money?” askedantipholus of syracuse.this drornio knew of no money except sixpence, which he had received onthe previous wednesday and given to the saddler; but he did know thathis mistress was annoyed because his master was not in to dinner, and heasked antipholus of syracuse to go to a house called the phoenix withoutdelay. his speech angered the hearer, who would have beaten him if hehad not fled. antipholus of syracuse them went to the centaur, foundthat his gold had been deposited there, and walked out of the inn.he was wandering about ephesus when two beautiful ladies signaled to himwith their hands. they were sisters, and their names were adriana andluciana. adriana was the wife of his brother antipholus of ephesus, andshe had made up her mind, from the strange account given her by dromioof ephesus, that her husband preferred another woman to his wife. “ay,you may look as if you did not know me,” she said to the man who wasreally her brother-in-law, “but i can remember when no words were sweetunless i said them, no meat flavorsome unless i carved it.”“is it i you address?” said antipholus of syracuse stiffly. “i do notknow you.”“fie, brother,” said luciana. “you know perfectly well that she sentdromio to you to bid you come to dinner;” and adriana said, “come, come;i have been made a fool of long enough. my truant husband shall dinewith me and confess his silly pranks and be forgiven.”they were determined ladies, and antipholus of syracuse grew weary ofdisputing with them, and followed them obediently to the phoenix, wherea very late “mid-day” dinner awaited them.they were at dinner when antipholus of ephesus and his slave dromiodemanded admittance. “maud, bridget, marian, cecily, gillian, ginn!” shouted dromio of ephesus, who knew all his fellow-servants\\' names byheart.from within came the reply, “fool, dray-horse, coxcomb, idiot!” it wasdromio of syracuse unconsciously insulting his brother.master and man did their best to get in, short of using a crowbar, andfinally went away; but antipholus of ephesus felt so annoyed with hiswife that he decided to give a gold chain which he had promised her, toanother woman.inside the phoenix, luciana, who believed antipholus of syracuse to beher sister\\'s husband, attempted, by a discourse in rhyme, when alonewith him, to make him kinder to adriana. in reply he told her that hewas not married, but that he loved her so much that, if luciana were amermaid, he would gladly lie on the sea if he might feel beneath him herfloating golden hair.luciana was shocked and left him, and reported his lovemaking toadriana, who said that her husband was old and ugly, and not fit to beseen or heard, though secretly she was very fond of him.antipholus of syracuse soon received a visitor in the shape of angelothe goldsmith, of whom antipholus of ephesus had ordered the chain whichhe had promised his wife and intended to give to another woman.the goldsmith handed the chain to antipholus of syracuse, and treatedhis “i bespoke it not” as mere fun, so that the puzzled merchant tookthe chain as good-humoredly as he had partaken of adriana\\'s dinner. heoffered payment, but angelo foolishly said he would call again.the consequence was that angelo was without money when a creditor of thesort that stands no nonsense, threatened him with arrest unless he paidhis debt immediately. this creditor had brought a police officer withhim, and angelo was relieved to see antipholus of ephesus coming out ofthe house where he had been dining because he had been locked out of thephoenix. bitter was angelo\\'s dismay when antipholus denied receipt ofthe chain. angelo could have sent his mother to prison if she had saidthat, and he gave antipholus of ephesus in charge.at this moment up came dromio of syracuse and told the wrong antipholusthat he had shipped his goods, and that a favorable wind was blowing.to the ears of antipholus of ephesus this talk was simple nonsense. hewould gladly have beaten the slave, but contented himself with crosslytelling him to hurry to adriana and bid her send to her arrested husbanda purse of money which she would find in his desk.though adriana was furious with her husband because she thought he hadbeen making love to her sister, she did not prevent luciana fromgetting the purse, and she bade dromio of syracuse bring home his masterimmediately.unfortunately, before dromio could reach the police station he met hisreal master, who had never been arrested, and did not understand whathe meant by offering him a purse. antipholus of syracuse was furthersurprised when a lady whom he did not know asked him for a chain that hehad promised her. she was, of course, the lady with whom antipholus ofephesus had dined when his brother was occupying his place at table.“avaunt, thou witch!” was the answer which, to her astonishment, shereceived.meanwhile antipholus of ephesus waited vainly for the money which wasto have released him. never a good-tempered man, he was crazy with angerwhen dromio of ephesus, who, of course, had not been instructed to fetcha purse, appeared with nothing more useful than a rope. he beat theslave in the street despite the remonstrance of the police officer;and his temper did not mend when adriana, luciana, and a doctor arrivedunder the impression that he was mad and must have his pulse felt. heraged so much that men came forward to bind him. but the kindness ofadriana spared him this shame. she promised to pay the sum demanded ofhim, and asked the doctor to lead him to the phoenix.angelo\\'s merchant creditor being paid, the two were friendly again,and might soon have been seen chatting before an abbey about the oddbehavior of antipholus of ephesus. “softly,” said the merchant at last,“that\\'s he, i think.”it was not; it was antipholus of syracuse with his servant dromio,and he wore angelo\\'s chain round his neck! the reconciled pair fairlypounced upon him to know what he meant by denying the receipt of thechain he had the impudence to wear. antipholus of syracuse lost histemper, and drew his sword, and at that moment adriana and severalothers appeared. “hold!” shouted the careful wife. “hurt him not; he ismad. take his sword away. bind him--and dromio too.”dromio of syracuse did not wish to be bound, and he said to his master,“run, master! into that abbey, quick, or we shall be robbed!”they accordingly retreated into the abbey.adriana, luciana, and a crowd remained outside, and the abbess came out,and said, “people, why do you gather here?”“to fetch my poor distracted husband,” replied adriana.angelo and the merchant remarked that they had not known that he wasmad.adriana then told the abbess rather too much about her wifely worries,for the abbess received the idea that adriana was a shrew, and thatif her husband was distracted he had better not return to her for thepresent.adriana determined, therefore, to complain to duke solinus, and, lo andbehold! a minute afterwards the great man appeared with officers and twoothers. the others were aegeon and the headsman. the thousand marks hadnot been found, and aegeon\\'s fate seemed sealed.ere the duke could pass the abbey adriana knelt before him, and told awoeful tale of a mad husband rushing about stealing jewelry and drawinghis sword, adding that the abbess refused to allow her to lead him home.the duke bade the abbess be summoned, and no sooner had he given theorder than a servant from the phoenix ran to adriana with the tale thathis master had singed off the doctor\\'s beard.“nonsense!” said adriana, “he\\'s in the abbey.”“as sure as i live i speak the truth,” said the servant.antipholus of syracuse had not come out of the abbey, before hisbrother of ephesus prostrated himself in front of the duke, exclaiming,“justice, most gracious duke, against that woman.” he pointed toadriana. “she has treated another man like her husband in my own house.”even while he was speaking aegeon said, “unless i am delirious, i see myson antipholus.”no one noticed him, and antipholus of ephesus went on to say how thedoctor, whom he called “a threadbare juggler,” had been one of a gangwho tied him to his slave dromio, and thrust them into a vault whence hehad escaped by gnawing through his bonds.the duke could not understand how the same man who spoke to him wasseen to go into the abbey, and he was still wondering when aegeon askedantipholus of ephesus if he was not his son. he replied, “i never sawmy father in my life;” but so deceived was aegeon by his likeness tothe brother whom he had brought up, that he said, “thou art ashamed toacknowledge me in misery.”soon, however, the abbess advanced with antipholus of syracuse anddromio of syracuse.then cried adriana, “i see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me;” andantipholus, espying his father, said, “thou art aegeon or his ghost.”it was a day of surprises, for the abbess said, “i will free that man bypaying his fine, and gain my husband whom i lost. speak, aegeon, for iam thy wife aemilia.”the duke was touched. “he is free without a fine,” he said.so aegeon and aemilia were reunited, and adriana and her husbandreconciled; but no one was happier than antipholus of syracuse, who, inthe duke\\'s presence, went to luciana and said, “i told you i loved you.will you be my wife?”her answer was given by a look, and therefore is not written.the two dromios were glad to think they would receive no more beatings.the merchant of veniceantonio was a rich and prosperous merchant of venice. his ships wereon nearly every sea, and he traded with portugal, with mexico, withengland, and with india. although proud of his riches, he was verygenerous with them, and delighted to use them in relieving the wants ofhis friends, among whom his relation, bassanio, held the first place.now bassanio, like many another gay and gallant gentleman, was recklessand extravagant, and finding that he had not only come to the end of hisfortune, but was also unable to pay his creditors, he went to antoniofor further help.“to you, antonio,” he said, “i owe the most in money and in love: and ihave thought of a plan to pay everything i owe if you will but help me.”“say what i can do, and it shall be done,” answered his friend.then said bassanio, “in belmont is a lady richly left, and from allquarters of the globe renowned suitors come to woo her, not only becauseshe is rich, but because she is beautiful and good as well. she lookedon me with such favor when last we met, that i feel sure that i shouldwin her away from all rivals for her love had i but the means to go tobelmont, where she lives.”“all my fortunes,” said antonio, “are at sea, and so i have no readymoney; but luckily my credit is good in venice, and i will borrow foryou what you need.”there was living in venice at this time a rich money-lender, namedshylock. antonio despised and disliked this man very much, and treatedhim with the greatest harshness and scorn. he would thrust him, like acur, over his threshold, and would even spit on him. shylock submittedto all these indignities with a patient shrug; but deep in his heart hecherished a desire for revenge on the rich, smug merchant. for antonioboth hurt his pride and injured his business. “but for him,” thoughtshylock, “i should be richer by half a million ducats. on the marketplace, and wherever he can, he denounces the rate of interest i charge,and--worse than that--he lends out money freely.”so when bassanio came to him to ask for a loan of three thousand ducatsto antonio for three months, shylock hid his hatred, and turning toantonio, said--“harshly as you have treated me, i would be friends withyou and have your love. so i will lend you the money and charge you nointerest. but, just for fun, you shall sign a bond in which it shall beagreed that if you do not repay me in three months\\' time, then i shallhave the right to a pound of your flesh, to be cut from what part ofyour body i choose.”“no,” cried bassanio to his friend, “you shall run no such risk for me.”“why, fear not,” said antonio, “my ships will be home a month before thetime. i will sign the bond.”thus bassanio was furnished with the means to go to belmont, there towoo the lovely portia. the very night he started, the money-lender\\'spretty daughter, jessica, ran away from her father\\'s house with herlover, and she took with her from her father\\'s hoards some bags ofducats and precious stones. shylock\\'s grief and anger were terrible tosee. his love for her changed to hate. “i would she were dead at myfeet and the jewels in her ear,” he cried. his only comfort now was inhearing of the serious losses which had befallen antonio, some of whoseships were wrecked. “let him look to his bond,” said shylock, “let himlook to his bond.”meanwhile bassanio had reached belmont, and had visited the fair portia.he found, as he had told antonio, that the rumor of her wealth andbeauty had drawn to her suitors from far and near. but to all of themportia had but one reply. she would only accept that suitor who wouldpledge himself to abide by the terms of her father\\'s will. these wereconditions that frightened away many an ardent wooer. for he who wouldwin portia\\'s heart and hand, had to guess which of three caskets heldher portrait. if he guessed aright, then portia would be his bride; ifwrong, then he was bound by oath never to reveal which casket he chose,never to marry, and to go away at once.the caskets were of gold, silver, and lead. the gold one bore thisinscription:--“who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;” the silver one had this:--“who chooseth me shall get as much as hedeserves;” while on the lead one were these words:--“who chooseth memust give and hazard all he hath.” the prince of morocco, as brave as hewas black, was among the first to submit to this test. he chose thegold casket, for he said neither base lead nor silver could contain herpicture. so be chose the gold casket, and found inside the likeness ofwhat many men desire--death.after him came the haughty prince of arragon, and saying, “let me havewhat i deserve--surely i deserve the lady,” he chose the silver one, andfound inside a fool\\'s head. “did i deserve no more than a fool\\'s head?” he cried.then at last came bassanio, and portia would have delayed him frommaking his choice from very fear of his choosing wrong. for she lovedhim dearly, even as he loved her. “but,” said bassanio, “let me choose atonce, for, as i am, i live upon the rack.”then portia bade her servants to bring music and play while her gallantlover made his choice. and bassanio took the oath and walked up to thecaskets--the musicians playing softly the while. “mere outward show,” hesaid, “is to be despised. the world is still deceived with ornament, andso no gaudy gold or shining silver for me. i choose the lead casket;joy be the consequence!” and opening it, he found fair portia\\'s portraitinside, and he turned to her and asked if it were true that she was his.“yes,” said portia, “i am yours, and this house is yours, and with themi give you this ring, from which you must never part.”and bassanio, saying that he could hardly speak for joy, found words toswear that he would never part with the ring while he lived.then suddenly all his happiness was dashed with sorrow, for messengerscame from venice to tell him that antonio was ruined, and that shylockdemanded from the duke the fulfilment of the bond, under which he wasentitled to a pound of the merchant\\'s flesh. portia was as grieved asbassanio to hear of the danger which threatened his friend.“first,” she said, “take me to church and make me your wife, and thengo to venice at once to help your friend. you shall take with you moneyenough to pay his debt twenty times over.”but when her newly-made husband had gone, portia went after him, andarrived in venice disguised as a lawyer, and with an introduction froma celebrated lawyer bellario, whom the duke of venice had called into decide the legal questions raised by shylock\\'s claim to a pound ofantonio\\'s flesh. when the court met, bassanio offered shylock twice themoney borrowed, if he would withdraw his claim. but the money-lender\\'sonly answer was--   “if every ducat in six thousand ducats,    were in six parts, and every part a ducat,    i would not draw them,--i would have my bond.”it was then that portia arrived in her disguise, and not even her ownhusband knew her. the duke gave her welcome on account of the greatbellario\\'s introduction, and left the settlement of the case to her.then in noble words she bade shylock have mercy. but he was deaf to herentreaties. “i will have the pound of flesh,” was his reply.“what have you to say?” asked portia of the merchant.“but little,” he answered; “i am armed and well prepared.”“the court awards you a pound of antonio\\'s flesh,” said portia to themoney-lender.“most righteous judge!” cried shylock. “a sentence: come, prepare.”“tarry a little. this bond gives you no right to antonio\\'s blood, onlyto his flesh. if, then, you spill a drop of his blood, all your propertywill be forfeited to the state. such is the law.”and shylock, in his fear, said, “then i will take bassanio\\'s offer.”“no,” said portia sternly, “you shall have nothing but your bond. takeyour pound of flesh, but remember, that if you take more or less, evenby the weight of a hair, you will lose your property and your life.”shylock now grew very much frightened. “give me my three thousand ducatsthat i lent him, and let him go.”bassanio would have paid it to him, but said portia, “no! he shall havenothing but his bond.”“you, a foreigner,” she added, “have sought to take the life of avenetian citizen, and thus by the venetian law, your life and goods areforfeited. down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke.”thus were the tables turned, and no mercy would have been shown toshylock had it not been for antonio. as it was, the money-lenderforfeited half his fortune to the state, and he had to settle the otherhalf on his daughter\\'s husband, and with this he had to be content.bassanio, in his gratitude to the clever lawyer, was induced to partwith the ring his wife had given him, and with which he had promisednever to part, and when on his return to belmont he confessed as much toportia, she seemed very angry, and vowed she would not be friends withhim until she had her ring again. but at last she told him that it wasshe who, in the disguise of the lawyer, had saved his friend\\'s life, andgot the ring from him. so bassanio was forgiven, and made happierthan ever, to know how rich a prize he had drawn in the lottery of thecaskets.timon of athensfour hundred years before the birth of christ, a man lived in athenswhose generosity was not only great, but absurd. he was very rich, butno worldly wealth was enough for a man who spent and gave like timon. ifanybody gave timon a horse, he received from timon twenty better horses.if anybody borrowed money of timon and offered to repay it, timon wasoffended. if a poet had written a poem and timon had time to read it, hewould be sure to buy it; and a painter had only to hold up his canvas infront of timon to receive double its market price.flavius, his steward, looked with dismay at his reckless mode of life.when timon\\'s house was full of noisy lords drinking and spilling costlywine, flavius would sit in a cellar and cry. he would say to himself,“there are ten thousand candles burning in this house, and each of thosesingers braying in the concert-room costs a poor man\\'s yearly income anight;” and he would remember a terrible thing said by apemantus, one ofhis master\\'s friends, “o what a number of men eat timon, and timon seesthem not!”of course, timon was much praised.a jeweler who sold him a diamond pretended that it was not quite perfecttill timon wore it. “you mend the jewel by wearing it,” he said. timongave the diamond to a lord called sempronius, and the lord exclaimed,“o, he\\'s the very soul of bounty.” “timon is infinitely dear to me,” said another lord, called lucullus, to whom he gave a beautiful horse;and other athenians paid him compliments as sweet.but when apemantus had listened to some of them, he said, “i\\'m going toknock out an honest athenian\\'s brains.”“you will die for that,” said timon.“then i shall die for doing nothing,” said apemantus. and now you knowwhat a joke was like four hundred years before christ.this apernantus was a frank despiser of mankind, but a healthy one,because he was not unhappy. in this mixed world anyone with a numberof acquaintances knows a person who talks bitterly of men, but does notshun them, and boasts that he is never deceived by their fine speeches,and is inwardly cheerful and proud. apemantus was a man like that.timon, you will be surprised to hear, became much worse than apemantus,after the dawning of a day which we call quarter day.quarter day is the day when bills pour in. the grocer, the butcher, andthe baker are all thinking of their debtors on that day, and the wiseman has saved enough money to be ready for them. but timon had not; andhe did not only owe money for food. he owed it for jewels and horses andfurniture; and, worst of all, he owed it to money-lenders, who expectedhim to pay twice as much as he had borrowed.quarter day is a day when promises to pay are scorned, and on that daytimon was asked for a large sum of money. “sell some land,” he saidto his steward. “you have no land,” was the reply. “nonsense! i had ahundred, thousand acres,” said timon. “you could have spent the price ofthe world if you had possessed it,” said flavius.“borrow some then,” said timon; “try ventidius.” he thought of ventidiusbecause he had once got ventidius out of prison by paying a creditor ofthis young man. ventidius was now rich. timon trusted in his gratitude.but not for all; so much did he owe! servants were despatched withrequests for loans of money to several friends:one servant (flaminius) went to lucullus. when he was announced lucullussaid, “a gift, i warrant. i dreamt of a silver jug and basin lastnight.” then, changing his tone, “how is that honorable, free-hearted,perfect gentleman, your master, eh?”“well in health, sir,” replied flaminius.“and what have you got there under your cloak?” asked lucullus,jovially.“faith, sir, nothing but an empty box, which, on my master\\'s behalf, ibeg you to fill with money, sir.”“la! la! la!” said lucullus, who could not pretend to mean, “ha! ha!ha!” “your master\\'s one fault is that he is too fond of giving parties.i\\'ve warned him that it was expensive. now, look here, flaminius, youknow this is no time to lend money without security, so suppose youact like a good boy and tell him that i was not at home. here\\'s threesolidares for yourself.”“back, wretched money,” cried flaminius, “to him who worships you!”others of timon\\'s friends were tried and found stingy. amongst them wassempronius.“hum,” he said to timon\\'s servant, “has he asked ventidius? ventidius isbeholden to him.”“he refused.”“well, have you asked lucullus?”“he refused.”“a poor compliment to apply to me last of all,” said sempronius, inaffected anger. “if he had sent to me at first, i would gladly have lenthim money, but i\\'m not going to be such a fool as to lend him any now.”“your lordship makes a good villain,” said the servant.when timon found that his friends were so mean, he took advantage ofa lull in his storm of creditors to invite ventidius and company to abanquet. flavius was horrified, but ventidius and company, were not inthe least ashamed, and they assembled accordingly in timon\\'s house, andsaid to one another that their princely host had been jesting with them.“i had to put off an important engagement in order to come here,” saidlucullus; “but who could refuse timon?”“it was a real grief to me to be without ready money when he asked forsome,” said sempronius.“the same here,” chimed in a third lord.timon now appeared, and his guests vied with one another in apologiesand compliments. inwardly sneering, timon was gracious to them all.in the banqueting ball was a table resplendent with covered dishes.mouths watered. these summer-friends loved good food.“be seated, worthy friends,” said timon. he then prayed aloud to thegods of greece. “give each man enough,” he said, “for if you, who areour gods, were to borrow of men they would cease to adore you. let menlove the joint more than the host. let every score of guests containtwenty villains. bless my friends as much as they have blessed me.uncover the dishes, dogs, and lap!”the hungry lords were too much surprised by this speech to resent it.they thought timon was unwell, and, although he had called them dogs,they uncovered the dishes.there was nothing in them but warm water.“may you never see a better feast,” wished timon “i wash off theflatteries with which you plastered me and sprinkle you with yourvillainy.” with these words he threw the water into his guests\\' faces,and then he pelted them with the dishes. having thus ended the banquet,he went into an outhouse, seized a spade, and quitted athens for ever.his next dwelling was a cave near the sea.of all his friends, the only one who had not refused him aid was ahandsome soldier named alcibiades, and he had not been asked because,having quarreled with the government of athens, he had left that town.the thought that alcibiades might have proved a true friend did notsoften timon\\'s bitter feeling. he was too weak-minded to discernthe fact that good cannot be far from evil in this mixed world. hedetermined to see nothing better in all mankind than the ingratitude ofventidius and the meanness of lucullus.he became a vegetarian, and talked pages to himself as he dug in theearth for food.one day, when he was digging for roots near the shore, his spade struckgold. if he had been a wise man he would have enriched himself quickly,and returned to athens to live in comfort. but the sight of the goldvein gave no joy but only scorn to timon. “this yellow slave,” he said,“will make and break religions. it will make black white and foul fair.it will buy murder and bless the accursed.”he was still ranting when alcibiades, now an enemy of athens, approachedwith his soldiers and two beautiful women who cared for nothing butpleasure.timon was so changed by his bad thoughts and rough life that alcibiadesdid not recognize him at first.“who are you?” he asked.“a beast, as you are,” was the reply.alcibiades knew his voice, and offered him help and money. but timonwould none of it, and began to insult the women. they, however, whenthey found he had discovered a gold mine, cared not a jot for hisopinion of them, but said, “give us some gold, good timon. have youmore?”with further insults, timon filled their aprons with gold ore.“farewell,” said alcibiades, who deemed that timon\\'s wits were lost; andthen his disciplined soldiers left without profit the mine which couldhave paid their wages, and marched towards athens.timon continued to dig and curse, and affected great delight when he dugup a root and discovered that it was not a grape.just then apemantus appeared. “i am told that you imitate me,” saidapemantus. “only,” said timon, “because you haven\\'t a dog which i canimitate.”“you are revenging yourself on your friends by punishing yourself,” saidapemantus. “that is very silly, for they live just as comfortably asthey ever did. i am sorry that a fool should imitate me.”“if i were like you,” said timon, “i should throw myself away.”“you have done so,” sneered apemantus. “will the cold brook make you agood morning drink, or an east wind warm your clothes as a valet would?”“off with you!” said timon; but apemantus stayed a while longer and toldhim he had a passion for extremes, which was true. apemantus even made apun, but there was no good laughter to be got out of timon.finally, they lost their temper like two schoolboys, and timon said hewas sorry to lose the stone which he flung at apemantus, who left himwith an evil wish.this was almost an “at home” day for timon, for when apemantus haddeparted, he was visited by some robbers. they wanted gold.“you want too much,” said timon. “here are water, roots and berries.”“we are not birds and pigs,” said a robber.“no, you are cannibals,” said timon. “take the gold, then, and may itpoison you! henceforth rob one another.”he spoke so frightfully to them that, though they went away with fullpockets, they almost repented of their trade. his last visitor on thatday of visits was his good steward flavius. “my dearest master!” criedhe.“away! what are you?” said timon.“have you forgotten me, sir?” asked flavius, mournfully.“i have forgotten all men,” was the reply; “and if you\\'ll allow that youare a man, i have forgotten you.”“i was your honest servant,” said flavius.“nonsense! i never had an honest man about me,” retorted timon.flavius began to cry.“what! shedding tears?” said timon. “come nearer, then. i will love youbecause you are a woman, and unlike men, who only weep when they laughor beg.”they talked awhile; then timon said, “yon gold is mine. i will make yourich, flavius, if you promise me to live by yourself and hate mankind.i will make you very rich if you promise me that you will see the fleshslide off the beggar\\'s bones before you feed him, and let the debtor diein jail before you pay his debt.”flavius simply said, “let me stay to comfort you, my master.”“if you dislike cursing, leave me,” replied timon, and he turned hisback on flavius, who went sadly back to athens, too much accustomed toobedience to force his services upon his ailing master.the steward had accepted nothing, but a report got about that a mightynugget of gold had been given him by his former master, and timontherefore received more visitors. they were a painter and a poet, whomhe had patronized in his prosperity.“hail, worthy timon!” said the poet. “we heard with astonishment howyour friends deserted you. no whip\\'s large enough for their backs!”“we have come,” put in the painter, “to offer our services.”“you\\'ve heard that i have gold,” said timon.“there was a report,” said the painter, blushing; “but my friend and idid not come for that.”“good honest men!” jeered timon. “all the same, you shall have plenty ofgold if you will rid me of two villains.”“name them,” said his two visitors in one breath. “both of you!” answered timon. giving the painter a whack with a big stick, he said,“put that into your palette and make money out of it.” then he gave awhack to the poet, and said, “make a poem out of that and get paid forit. there\\'s gold for you.”they hurriedly withdrew.finally timon was visited by two senators who, now that athens wasthreatened by alcibiades, desired to have on their side this bitternoble whose gold might help the foe.“forget your injuries,” said the first senator. “athens offers youdignities whereby you may honorably live.”“athens confesses that your merit was overlooked, and wishes to atone,and more than atone, for her forgetfulness,” said the second senator.“worthy senators,” replied timon, in his grim way, “i am almost weeping;you touch me so! all i need are the eyes of a woman and the heart of afool.”but the senators were patriots. they believed that this bitter man couldsave athens, and they would not quarrel with him. “be our captain,” they said, “and lead athens against alcibiades, who threatens to destroyher.”“let him destroy the athenians too, for all i care,” said timon; andseeing an evil despair in his face, they left him.the senators returned to athens, and soon afterwards trumpets were blownbefore its walls. upon the walls they stood and listened to alcibiades,who told them that wrong-doers should quake in their easy chairs. theylooked at his confident army, and were convinced that athens must yieldif he assaulted it, therefore they used the voice that strikes deeperthan arrows.“these walls of ours were built by the hands of men who never wrongedyou, alcibiades,” said the first senator.“enter,” said the second senator, “and slay every tenth man, if yourrevenge needs human flesh.”“spare the cradle,” said the first senator.“i ask only justice,” said alcibiades. “if you admit my army, i willinflict the penalty of your own laws upon any soldier who breaks them.”at that moment a soldier approached alcibiades, and said, “my noblegeneral, timon is dead.” he handed alcibiades a sheet of wax, saying,“he is buried by the sea, on the beach, and over his grave is a stonewith letters on it which i cannot read, and therefore i have impressedthem on wax.”alcibiades read from the sheet of wax this couplet--   “here lie i, timon, who, alive,        all living men did hate.    pass by and say your worst; but pass,        and stay not here your gait.”“dead, then, is noble timon,” said alcibiades; and be entered athenswith an olive branch instead of a sword.so it was one of timon\\'s friends who was generous in a greater matterthan timon\\'s need; yet are the sorrow and rage of timon remembered as awarning lest another ingratitude should arise to turn love into hate.othellofour hundred years ago there lived in venice an ensign named iago, whohated his general, othello, for not making him a lieutenant. instead ofiago, who was strongly recommended, othello had chosen michael cassio,whose smooth tongue had helped him to win the heart of desdemona. iagohad a friend called roderigo, who supplied him with money and felt hecould not be happy unless desdemona was his wife.othello was a moor, but of so dark a complexion that his enemies calledhim a blackamoor. his life had been hard and exciting. he had beenvanquished in battle and sold into slavery; and he had been a greattraveler and seen men whose shoulders were higher than their heads.brave as a lion, he had one great fault--jealousy. his love was aterrible selfishness. to love a woman meant with him to possess her asabsolutely as he possessed something that did not live and think. thestory of othello is a story of jealousy.one night iago told roderigo that othello had carried off desdemonawithout the knowledge of her father, brabantio. he persuaded roderigoto arouse brabantio, and when that senator appeared iago told himof desdemona\\'s elopement in the most unpleasant way. though he wasothello\\'s officer, he termed him a thief and a barbary horse.brabantio accused othello before the duke of venice of using sorcery tofascinate his daughter, but othello said that the only sorcery he usedwas his voice, which told desdemona his adventures and hair-breadthescapes. desdemona was led into the council-chamber, and she explainedhow she could love othello despite his almost black face by saying, “isaw othello\\'s visage in his mind.”as othello had married desdemona, and she was glad to be his wife, therewas no more to be said against him, especially as the duke wished him togo to cyprus to defend it against the turks. othello was quite ready togo, and desdemona, who pleaded to go with him, was permitted to join himat cyprus.othello\\'s feelings on landing in this island were intensely joyful. “oh,my sweet,” he said to desdemona, who arrived with iago, his wife, androderigo before him, “i hardly know what i say to you. i am in love withmy own happiness.”news coming presently that the turkish fleet was out of action, heproclaimed a festival in cyprus from five to eleven at night.cassio was on duty in the castle where othello ruled cyprus, so iagodecided to make the lieutenant drink too much. he had some difficulty,as cassio knew that wine soon went to his head, but servants broughtwine into the room where cassio was, and iago sang a drinking song, andso cassio lifted a glass too often to the health of the general.when cassio was inclined to be quarrelsome, iago told roderigo to saysomething unpleasant to him. cassio cudgeled roderigo, who ran into thepresence of montano, the ex-governor. montano civilly interceded forroderigo, but received so rude an answer from cassio that he said,“come, come, you\\'re drunk!” cassio then wounded him, and iago sentroderigo out to scare the town with a cry of mutiny.the uproar aroused othello, who, on learning its cause, said, “cassio, ilove thee, but never more be officer of mine.”on cassio and iago being alone together, the disgraced man moaned abouthis reputation. iago said reputation and humbug were the same thing.“o god,” exclaimed cassio, without heeding him, “that men should put anenemy in their mouths to steal away their brains!”iago advised him to beg desdemona to ask othello to pardon him. cassiowas pleased with the advice, and next morning made his request todesdemona in the garden of the castle. she was kindness itself, andsaid, “be merry, cassio, for i would rather die than forsake yourcause.”cassio at that moment saw othello advancing with iago, and retiredhurriedly.iago said, “i don\\'t like that.”“what did you say?” asked othello, who felt that he had meant somethingunpleasant, but iago pretended he had said nothing. “was not that cassiowho went from my wife?” asked othello, and iago, who knew that it wascassio and why it was cassio, said, “i cannot think it was cassio whostole away in that guilty manner.”desdemona told othello that it was grief and humility which made cassioretreat at his approach. she reminded him how cassio had taken his partwhen she was still heart-free, and found fault with her moorish lover.othello was melted, and said, “i will deny thee nothing,” but desdemonatold him that what she asked was as much for his good as dining.desdemona left the garden, and iago asked if it was really true thatcassio had known desdemona before her marriage.“yes,” said othello.“indeed,” said iago, as though something that had mystified him was nowvery clear.“is he not honest?” demanded othello, and iago repeated the adjectiveinquiringly, as though he were afraid to say “no.”“what do you mean?” insisted othello.to this iago would only say the flat opposite of what he said to cassio.he had told cassio that reputation was humbug. to othello he said, “whosteals my purse steals trash, but he who filches from me my good nameruins me.”at this othello almost leapt into the air, and iago was so confidentof his jealousy that he ventured to warn him against it. yes, it was noother than iago who called jealousy “the green-eyed monster which dothmock the meat it feeds on.”iago having given jealousy one blow, proceeded to feed it with theremark that desdemona deceived her father when she eloped with othello.“if she deceived him, why not you?” was his meaning.presently desdemona re-entered to tell othello that dinner was ready.she saw that he was ill at ease. he explained it by a pain in hisforehead. desdemona then produced a handkerchief, which othellohad given her. a prophetess, two hundred years old, had made thishandkerchief from the silk of sacred silkworms, dyed it in aliquid prepared from the hearts of maidens, and embroidered it withstrawberries. gentle desdemona thought of it simply as a cool, softthing for a throbbing brow; she knew of no spell upon it that would workdestruction for her who lost it. “let me tie it round your head,” shesaid to othello; “you will be well in an hour.” but othello pettishlysaid it was too small, and let it fall. desdemona and he then wentindoors to dinner, and emilia picked up the handkerchief which iago hadoften asked her to steal.she was looking at it when iago came in. after a few words about it hesnatched it from her, and bade her leave him.in the garden he was joined by othello, who seemed hungry for the worstlies he could offer. he therefore told othello that he had seen cassiowipe his mouth with a handkerchief, which, because it was spotted withstrawberries, he guessed to be one that othello had given his wife.the unhappy moor went mad with fury, and iago bade the heavens witnessthat he devoted his hand and heart and brain to othello\\'s service. “iaccept your love,” said othello. “within three days let me hear thatcassio is dead.”iago\\'s next step was to leave desdemona\\'s handkerchief in cassio\\'s room.cassio saw it, and knew it was not his, but he liked the strawberrypattern on it, and he gave it to his sweetheart bianca and asked her tocopy it for him.iago\\'s next move was to induce othello, who had been bullying desdemonaabout the handkerchief, to play the eavesdropper to a conversationbetween cassio and himself. his intention was to talk about cassio\\'ssweetheart, and allow othello to suppose that the lady spoken of wasdesdemona.“how are you, lieutenant?” asked iago when cassio appeared.“the worse for being called what i am not,” replied cassio, gloomily.“keep on reminding desdemona, and you\\'ll soon be restored,” said iago,adding, in a tone too low for othello to hear, “if bianca could set thematter right, how quickly it would mend!”“alas! poor rogue,” said cassio, “i really think she loves me,” and likethe talkative coxcomb he was, cassio was led on to boast of bianca\\'sfondness for him, while othello imagined, with choked rage, that heprattled of desdemona, and thought, “i see your nose, cassio, but notthe dog i shall throw it to.”othello was still spying when bianca entered, boiling over with the ideathat cassio, whom she considered her property, had asked her to copy theembroidery on the handkerchief of a new sweetheart. she tossed him thehandkerchief with scornful words, and cassio departed with her.othello had seen bianca, who was in station lower, in beauty and speechinferior far, to desdemona and he began in spite of himself to praisehis wife to the villain before him. he praised her skill with theneedle, her voice that could “sing the savageness out of a bear,” herwit, her sweetness, the fairness of her skin. every time he praisedher iago said something that made him remember his anger and utter itfoully, and yet he must needs praise her, and say, “the pity of it,iago! o iago, the pity of it, iago!”there was never in all iago\\'s villainy one moment of wavering. if therehad been he might have wavered then.“strangle her,” he said; and “good, good!” said his miserable dupe.the pair were still talking murder when desdemona appeared with arelative of desdemona\\'s father, called lodovico, who bore a letterfor othello from the duke of venice. the letter recalled othello fromcyprus, and gave the governorship to cassio.luckless desdemona seized this unhappy moment to urge once more the suitof cassio.“fire and brimstone!” shouted othello.“it may be the letter agitates him,” explained lodovico to desdemona,and he told her what it contained.“i am glad,” said desdemona. it was the first bitter speech thatothello\\'s unkindness had wrung out of her.“i am glad to see you lose your temper,” said othello.“why, sweet othello?” she asked, sarcastically; and othello slapped herface.now was the time for desdemona to have saved her life by separation, butshe knew not her peril--only that her love was wounded to the core. “ihave not deserved this,” she said, and the tears rolled slowly down herface.lodovico was shocked and disgusted. “my lord,” he said, “this would notbe believed in venice. make her amends;” but, like a madman talking inhis nightmare, othello poured out his foul thought in ugly speech, androared, “out of my sight!”“i will not stay to offend you,” said his wife, but she lingered even ingoing, and only when he shouted “avaunt!” did she leave her husband andhis guests.othello then invited lodovico to supper, adding, “you are welcome, sir,to cyprus. goats and monkeys!” without waiting for a reply he left thecompany.distinguished visitors detest being obliged to look on at familyquarrels, and dislike being called either goats or monkeys, and lodovicoasked iago for an explanation.true to himself, iago, in a round-about way, said that othello was worsethan he seemed, and advised them to study his behavior and save him fromthe discomfort of answering any more questions.he proceeded to tell roderigo to murder cassio. roderigo was out of tunewith his friend. he had given iago quantities of jewels for desdemonawithout effect; desdemona had seen none of them, for iago was a thief.iago smoothed him with a lie, and when cassio was leaving bianca\\'shouse, roderigo wounded him, and was wounded in return. cassio shouted,and lodovico and a friend came running up. cassio pointed out roderigoas his assailant, and iago, hoping to rid himself of an inconvenientfriend, called him “villain!” and stabbed him, but not to death.at the castle, desdemona was in a sad mood. she told emilia that shemust leave her; her husband wished it. “dismiss me!” exclaimed emilia.“it was his bidding, said desdemona; we must not displease him now.”she sang a song which a girl had sung whose lover had been base toher--a song of a maiden crying by that tree whose boughs droop as thoughit weeps, and she went to bed and slept.she woke with her husband\\'s wild eyes upon her. “have you prayedto-night?” he asked; and he told this blameless and sweet woman to askgod\\'s pardon for any sin she might have on her conscience. “i would notkill thy soul,” he said.he told her that cassio had confessed, but she knew cassio had nought toconfess that concerned her. she said that cassio could not say anythingthat would damage her. othello said his mouth was stopped.then desdemona wept, but with violent words, in spite of all herpleading, othello pressed upon her throat and mortally hurt her.then with boding heart came emilia, and besought entrance at the door,and othello unlocked it, and a voice came from the bed saying, “aguiltless death i die.”“who did it?” cried emilia; and the voice said, “nobody--i myself.farewell!”“\\'twas i that killed her,” said othello.he poured out his evidence by that sad bed to the people who camerunning in, iago among them; but when he spoke of the handkerchief,emilia told the truth.and othello knew. “are there no stones in heaven but thunderbolts?” heexclaimed, and ran at iago, who gave emilia her death-blow and fled.but they brought him back, and the death that came to him later on was arelief from torture.they would have taken othello back to venice to try him there, but heescaped them on his sword. “a word or two before you go,” he said to thevenetians in the chamber. “speak of me as i was--no better, no worse.say i cast away the pearl of pearls, and wept with these hard eyes; andsay that, when in aleppo years ago i saw a turk beating a venetian, itook him by the throat and smote him thus.”with his own hand he stabbed himself to the heart; and ere he died hislips touched the face of desdemona with despairing love.the taming of the shrewthere lived in padua a gentleman named baptista, who had two fairdaughters. the eldest, katharine, was so very cross and ill-tempered,and unmannerly, that no one ever dreamed of marrying her, while hersister, bianca, was so sweet and pretty, and pleasant-spoken, that morethan one suitor asked her father for her hand. but baptista said theelder daughter must marry first.so bianca\\'s suitors decided among themselves to try and get some one tomarry katharine--and then the father could at least be got to listen totheir suit for bianca.a gentleman from verona, named petruchio, was the one they thoughtof, and, half in jest, they asked him if he would marry katharine, thedisagreeable scold. much to their surprise he said yes, that was justthe sort of wife for him, and if katharine were handsome and rich, hehimself would undertake soon to make her good-tempered.petruchio began by asking baptista\\'s permission to pay court to hisgentle daughter katharine--and baptista was obliged to own that shewas anything but gentle. and just then her music master rushed in,complaining that the naughty girl had broken her lute over his head,because he told her she was not playing correctly.“never mind,” said petruchio, “i love her better than ever, and long tohave some chat with her.”when katharine came, he said, “good-morrow, kate--for that, i hear, isyour name.”“you\\'ve only heard half,” said katharine, rudely.“oh, no,” said petruchio, “they call you plain kate, and bonny kate, andsometimes kate the shrew, and so, hearing your mildness praised in everytown, and your beauty too, i ask you for my wife.”“your wife!” cried kate. “never!” she said some extremely disagreeablethings to him, and, i am sorry to say, ended by boxing his ears.“if you do that again, i\\'ll cuff you,” he said quietly; and stillprotested, with many compliments, that he would marry none but her.when baptista came back, he asked at once--“how speed you with my daughter?”“how should i speed but well,” replied petruchio--“how, but well?”“how now, daughter katharine?” the father went on.“i don\\'t think,” said katharine, angrily, “you are acting a father\\'spart in wishing me to marry this mad-cap ruffian.”“ah!” said petruchio, “you and all the world would talk amiss of her.you should see how kind she is to me when we are alone. in short, i willgo off to venice to buy fine things for our wedding--for--kiss me, kate!we will be married on sunday.”with that, katharine flounced out of the room by one door in a violenttemper, and he, laughing, went out by the other. but whether she fell inlove with petruchio, or whether she was only glad to meet a man who wasnot afraid of her, or whether she was flattered that, in spite of herrough words and spiteful usage, he still desired her for his wife--shedid indeed marry him on sunday, as he had sworn she should.to vex and humble katharine\\'s naughty, proud spirit, he was late at thewedding, and when he came, came wearing such shabby clothes that she wasashamed to be seen with him. his servant was dressed in the same shabbyway, and the horses they rode were the sport of everyone they passed.and, after the marriage, when should have been the wedding breakfast,petruchio carried his wife away, not allowing her to eat ordrink--saying that she was his now, and he could do as he liked withher.and his manner was so violent, and he behaved all through his wedding inso mad and dreadful a manner, that katharine trembled and went with him.he mounted her on a stumbling, lean, old horse, and they journeyed byrough muddy ways to petruchio\\'s house, he scolding and snarling all theway.she was terribly tired when she reached her new home, but petruchio wasdetermined that she should neither eat nor sleep that night, for he hadmade up his mind to teach his bad-tempered wife a lesson she would neverforget.so he welcomed her kindly to his house, but when supper was servedhe found fault with everything--the meat was burnt, he said, andill-served, and he loved her far too much to let her eat anything butthe best. at last katharine, tired out with her journey, went supperlessto bed. then her husband, still telling her how he loved her, and howanxious he was that she should sleep well, pulled her bed to pieces,throwing the pillows and bedclothes on the floor, so that she could notgo to bed at all, and still kept growling and scolding at the servantsso that kate might see how unbeautiful a thing ill-temper was.the next day, too, katharine\\'s food was all found fault with, and caughtaway before she could touch a mouthful, and she was sick and giddy forwant of sleep. then she said to one of the servants--“i pray thee go and get me some repast. i care not what.”“what say you to a neat\\'s foot?” said the servant.katharine said “yes,” eagerly; but the servant, who was in his master\\'ssecret, said he feared it was not good for hasty-tempered people. wouldshe like tripe?“bring it me,” said katharine.“i don\\'t think that is good for hasty-tempered people,” said theservant. “what do you say to a dish of beef and mustard?”“i love it,” said kate.“but mustard is too hot.”“why, then, the beef, and let the mustard go,” cried katharine, who wasgetting hungrier and hungrier.“no,” said the servant, “you must have the mustard, or you get no beeffrom me.”“then,” cried katharine, losing patience, “let it be both, or one, oranything thou wilt.”“why, then,” said the servant, “the mustard without the beef!”then katharine saw he was making fun of her, and boxed his ears.just then petruchio brought her some food--but she had scarcely begunto satisfy her hunger, before he called for the tailor to bring her newclothes, and the table was cleared, leaving her still hungry. katharinewas pleased with the pretty new dress and cap that the tailor had madefor her, but petruchio found fault with everything, flung the cap andgown on the floor vowing his dear wife should not wear any such foolishthings.“i will have them,” cried katharine. “all gentlewomen wear such caps asthese--”“when you are gentle you shall have one too,” he answered, “and nottill then.” when he had driven away the tailor with angry words--butprivately asking his friend to see him paid--petruchio said--“come, kate, let\\'s go to your father\\'s, shabby as we are, for as thesun breaks through the darkest clouds, so honor peereth in the meanesthabit. it is about seven o\\'clock now. we shall easily get there bydinner-time.”“it\\'s nearly two,” said kate, but civilly enough, for she had grown tosee that she could not bully her husband, as she had done her father andher sister; “it\\'s nearly two, and it will be supper-time before we getthere.”“it shall be seven,” said petruchio, obstinately, “before i start. why,whatever i say or do, or think, you do nothing but contradict. i won\\'tgo to-day, and before i do go, it shall be what o\\'clock i say it is.”at last they started for her father\\'s house.“look at the moon,” said he.“it\\'s the sun,” said katharine, and indeed it was.“i say it is the moon. contradicting again! it shall be sun or moon, orwhatever i choose, or i won\\'t take you to your father\\'s.”then katharine gave in, once and for all. “what you will have it named,” she said, “it is, and so it shall be so for katharine.” and so it was,for from that moment katharine felt that she had met her master, andnever again showed her naughty tempers to him, or anyone else.so they journeyed on to baptista\\'s house, and arriving there, they foundall folks keeping bianca\\'s wedding feast, and that of another newlymarried couple, hortensio and his wife. they were made welcome, and satdown to the feast, and all was merry, save that hortensio\\'s wife, seeingkatharine subdued to her husband, thought she could safely say manydisagreeable things, that in the old days, when katharine was free andfroward, she would not have dared to say. but katharine answered withsuch spirit and such moderation, that she turned the laugh against thenew bride.after dinner, when the ladies had retired, baptista joined in a laughagainst petruchio, saying “now in good sadness, son petruchio, i fearyou have got the veriest shrew of all.”“you are wrong,” said petruchio, “let me prove it to you. each of usshall send a message to his wife, desiring her to come to him, and theone whose wife comes most readily shall win a wager which we will agreeon.”the others said yes readily enough, for each thought his own wife themost dutiful, and each thought he was quite sure to win the wager.they proposed a wager of twenty crowns.“twenty crowns,” said petruchio, “i\\'ll venture so much on my hawk orhound, but twenty times as much upon my wife.”“a hundred then,” cried lucentio, bianca\\'s husband.“content,” cried the others.then lucentio sent a message to the fair bianca bidding her to come tohim. and baptista said he was certain his daughter would come. but theservant coming back, said--“sir, my mistress is busy, and she cannot come.”\\'“there\\'s an answer for you,” said petruchio.“you may think yourself fortunate if your wife does not send you aworse.”“i hope, better,” petruchio answered. then hortensio said--“go and entreat my wife to come to me at once.”“oh--if you entreat her,” said petruchio.“i am afraid,” answered hortensio, sharply, “do what you can, yours willnot be entreated.”but now the servant came in, and said--“she says you are playing some jest, she will not come.”“better and better,” cried petruchio; “now go to your mistress and say icommand her to come to me.”they all began to laugh, saying they knew what her answer would be, andthat she would not come.then suddenly baptista cried--“here comes katharine!” and sure enough--there she was.“what do you wish, sir?” she asked her husband.“where are your sister and hortensio\\'s wife?”“talking by the parlor fire.”“fetch them here.”when she was gone to fetch them, lucentio said--“here is a wonder!”“i wonder what it means,” said hortensio.“it means peace,” said petruchio, “and love, and quiet life.”“well,” said baptista, “you have won the wager, and i will addanother twenty thousand crowns to her dowry--another dowry for anotherdaughter--for she is as changed as if she were someone else.”so petruchio won his wager, and had in katharine always a loving wifeand true, and now he had broken her proud and angry spirit he loved herwell, and there was nothing ever but love between those two. and so theylived happy ever afterwards.measure for measuremore centuries ago than i care to say, the people of vienna weregoverned too mildly. the reason was that the reigning duke vicentio wasexcessively good-natured, and disliked to see offenders made unhappy.the consequence was that the number of ill-behaved persons in viennawas enough to make the duke shake his head in sorrow when his chiefsecretary showed him it at the end of a list. he decided, therefore,that wrongdoers must be punished. but popularity was dear to him. heknew that, if he were suddenly strict after being lax, he would causepeople to call him a tyrant. for this reason he told his privy councilthat he must go to poland on important business of state. “i have chosenangelo to rule in my absence,” said he.now this angelo, although he appeared to be noble, was really a meanman. he had promised to marry a girl called mariana, and now would havenothing to say to her, because her dowry had been lost. so poor marianalived forlornly, waiting every day for the footstep of her stingy lover,and loving him still.having appointed angelo his deputy, the duke went to a friar calledthomas and asked him for a friar\\'s dress and instruction in the art ofgiving religious counsel, for he did not intend to go to poland, but tostay at home and see how angelo governed.angelo had not been a day in office when he condemned to death a youngman named claudio for an act of rash selfishness which nowadays wouldonly be punished by severe reproof.claudio had a queer friend called lucio, and lucio saw a chance offreedom for claudio if claudio\\'s beautiful sister isabella would pleadwith angelo.isabella was at that time living in a nunnery. nobody had won her heart,and she thought she would like to become a sister, or nun.meanwhile claudio did not lack an advocate.an ancient lord, escalus, was for leniency. “let us cut a little, butnot kill,” he said. “this gentleman had a most noble father.”angelo was unmoved. “if twelve men find me guilty, i ask no more mercythan is in the law.”angelo then ordered the provost to see that claudio was executed at ninethe next morning.after the issue of this order angelo was told that the sister of thecondemned man desired to see him.“admit her,” said angelo.on entering with lucio, the beautiful girl said, “i am a woeful suitorto your honor.”“well?” said angelo.she colored at his chill monosyllable and the ascending red increasedthe beauty of her face. “i have a brother who is condemned to die,” shecontinued. “condemn the fault, i pray you, and spare my brother.”“every fault,” said angelo, “is condemned before it is committed. afault cannot suffer. justice would be void if the committer of a faultwent free.”she would have left the court if lucio had not whispered to her, “youare too cold; you could not speak more tamely if you wanted a pin.”so isabella attacked angelo again, and when he said, “i will not pardonhim,” she was not discouraged, and when he said, “he\\'s sentenced; \\'tistoo late,” she returned to the assault. but all her fighting was withreasons, and with reasons she could not prevail over the deputy.she told him that nothing becomes power like mercy. she told him thathumanity receives and requires mercy from heaven, that it was good tohave gigantic strength, and had to use it like a giant. she told himthat lightning rives the oak and spares the myrtle. she bade him lookfor fault in his own breast, and if he found one, to refrain from makingit an argument against her brother\\'s life.angelo found a fault in his breast at that moment. he loved isabella\\'sbeauty, and was tempted to do for her beauty what he would not do forthe love of man.he appeared to relent, for he said, “come to me to-morrow before noon.”she had, at any rate, succeeded in prolonging her brother\\'s life for afew hours.\\'in her absence angelo\\'s conscience rebuked him for trifling with hisjudicial duty.when isabella called on him the second time, he said, “your brothercannot live.”isabella was painfully astonished, but all she said was, “even so.heaven keep your honor.”but as she turned to go, angelo felt that his duty and honor were slightin comparison with the loss of her.“give me your love,” he said, “and claudio shall be freed.”“before i would marry you, he should die if he had twenty heads to layupon the block,” said isabella, for she saw then that he was not thejust man he pretended to be.so she went to her brother in prison, to inform him that he must die.at first he was boastful, and promised to hug the darkness of death.but when he clearly understood that his sister could buy his life bymarrying angelo, he felt his life more valuable than her happiness, andhe exclaimed, “sweet sister, let me live.”“o faithless coward! o dishonest wretch!” she cried.at this moment the duke came forward, in the habit of a friar, torequest some speech with isabella. he called himself friar lodowick.the duke then told her that angelo was affianced to mariana, whoselove-story he related. he then asked her to consider this plan. letmariana, in the dress of isabella, go closely veiled to angelo, and say,in a voice resembling isabella\\'s, that if claudio were spared she wouldmarry him. let her take the ring from angelo\\'s little finger, that itmight be afterwards proved that his visitor was mariana.isabella had, of course, a great respect for friars, who are as nearlylike nuns as men can be. she agreed, therefore, to the duke\\'s plan. theywere to meet again at the moated grange, mariana\\'s house.in the street the duke saw lucio, who, seeing a man dressed like afriar, called out, “what news of the duke, friar?” “i have none,” saidthe duke.lucio then told the duke some stories about angelo. then he told oneabout the duke. the duke contradicted him. lucio was provoked, andcalled the duke “a shallow, ignorant fool,” though he pretended to lovehim. “the duke shall know you better if i live to report you,” said theduke, grimly. then he asked escalus, whom he saw in the street, what hethought of his ducal master. escalus, who imagined he was speaking to afriar, replied, “the duke is a very temperate gentleman, who prefers tosee another merry to being merry himself.”the duke then proceeded to call on mariana.isabella arrived immediately afterwards, and the duke introduced thetwo girls to one another, both of whom thought he was a friar. theywent into a chamber apart from him to discuss the saving of claudio, andwhile they talked in low and earnest tones, the duke looked out of thewindow and saw the broken sheds and flower-beds black with moss, whichbetrayed mariana\\'s indifference to her country dwelling. some womenwould have beautified their garden: not she. she was for the town; sheneglected the joys of the country. he was sure that angelo would notmake her unhappier.“we are agreed, father,” said isabella, as she returned with mariana.so angelo was deceived by the girl whom he had dismissed from his love,and put on her finger a ring he wore, in which was set a milky stonewhich flashed in the light with secret colors.hearing of her success, the duke went next day to the prison preparedto learn that an order had arrived for claudio\\'s release. it had not,however, but a letter was banded to the provost while he waited. hisamazement was great when the provost read aloud these words, “whatsoeveryou may hear to the contrary, let claudio be executed by four of theclock. let me have his head sent me by five.”but the duke said to the provost, “you must show the deputy anotherhead,” and he held out a letter and a signet. “here,” he said, “are thehand and seal of the duke. he is to return, i tell you, and angelo knowsit not. give angelo another head.”the provost thought, “this friar speaks with power. i know the duke\\'ssignet and i know his hand.”he said at length, “a man died in prison this morning, a pirate of theage of claudio, with a beard of his color. i will show his head.”the pirate\\'s head was duly shown to angelo, who was deceived by itsresemblance to claudio\\'s.the duke\\'s return was so popular that the citizens removed the citygates from their hinges to assist his entry into vienna. angelo andescalus duly presented themselves, and were profusely praised for theirconduct of affairs in the duke\\'s absence.it was, therefore, the more unpleasant for angelo when isabella,passionately angered by his treachery, knelt before the duke, and criedfor justice.when her story was told, the duke cried, “to prison with her for aslanderer of our right hand! but stay, who persuaded you to come here?”“friar lodowick,” said she.“who knows him?” inquired the duke.“i do, my lord,” replied lucio. “i beat him because he spake againstyour grace.”a friar called peter here said, “friar lodowick is a holy man.”isabella was removed by an officer, and mariana came forward. she tookoff her veil, and said to angelo, “this is the face you once swore wasworth looking on.”bravely he faced her as she put out her hand and said, “this is the handwhich wears the ring you thought to give another.”“i know the woman,” said angelo. “once there was talk of marriagebetween us, but i found her frivolous.”mariana here burst out that they were affianced by the strongest vows.angelo replied by asking the duke to insist on the production of friarlodowick.“he shall appear,” promised the duke, and bade escalus examine themissing witness thoroughly while he was elsewhere.presently the duke re-appeared in the character of friar lodowick, andaccompanied by isabella and the provost. he was not so much examined asabused and threatened by escalus. lucio asked him to deny, if he dared,that he called the duke a fool and a coward, and had had his nose pulledfor his impudence.“to prison with him!” shouted escalus, but as hands were laid upon him,the duke pulled off his friar\\'s hood, and was a duke before them all.“now,” he said to angelo, “if you have any impudence that can yet serveyou, work it for all it\\'s worth.”“immediate sentence and death is all i beg,” was the reply.“were you affianced to mariana?” asked the duke.“i was,” said angelo.“then marry her instantly,” said his master. “marry them,” he said tofriar peter, “and return with them here.”“come hither, isabel,” said the duke, in tender tones. “your friar isnow your prince, and grieves he was too late to save your brother;” butwell the roguish duke knew he had saved him.“o pardon me,” she cried, “that i employed my sovereign in my trouble.”“you are pardoned,” he said, gaily.at that moment angelo and his wife re-entered. “and now, angelo,” saidthe duke, gravely, “we condemn thee to the block on which claudio laidhis head!”“o my most gracious lord,” cried mariana, “mock me not!”“you shall buy a better husband,” said the duke.“o my dear lord,” said she, “i crave no better man.”isabella nobly added her prayer to mariana\\'s, but the duke feignedinflexibility.“provost,” he said, “how came it that claudio as executed at an unusualhour?”afraid to confess the lie he had imposed upon angelo, the provost said,“i had a private message.”“you are discharged from your office,” said the duke. the provost thendeparted. angelo said, “i am sorry to have caused such sorrow. i preferdeath to mercy.” soon there was a motion in the crowd. the provostre-appeared with claudio. like a big child the provost said, “isaved this man; he is like claudio.” the duke was amused, and said toisabella, “i pardon him because he is like your brother. he is like mybrother, too, if you, dear isabel, will be mine.”she was his with a smile, and the duke forgave angelo, and promoted theprovost.lucio he condemned to marry a stout woman with a bitter tongue.two gentlemen of veronaonly one of them was really a gentleman, as you will discover later.their names were valentine and proteus. they were friends, and livedat verona, a town in northern italy. valentine was happy in his namebecause it was that of the patron saint of lovers; it is hard for avalentine to be fickle or mean. proteus was unhappy in his name, becauseit was that of a famous shape-changer, and therefore it encouraged himto be a lover at one time and a traitor at another.one day, valentine told his friend that he was going to milan. “i\\'mnot in love like you,” said he, “and therefore i don\\'t want to stay athome.”proteus was in love with a beautiful yellow-haired girl called julia,who was rich, and had no one to order her about. he was, however, sorryto part from valentine, and he said, “if ever you are in danger tell me,and i will pray for you.” valentine then went to milan with a servantcalled speed, and at milan he fell in love with the duke of milan\\'sdaughter, silvia.when proteus and valentine parted julia had not acknowledged that sheloved proteus. indeed, she had actually torn up one of his letters inthe presence of her maid, lucetta. lucetta, however, was no simpleton,for when she saw the pieces she said to herself, “all she wants is to beannoyed by another letter.” indeed, no sooner had lucetta left her alonethan julia repented of her tearing, and placed between her dress and herheart the torn piece of paper on which proteus had signed his name. soby tearing a letter written by proteus she discovered that she lovedhim. then, like a brave, sweet girl, she wrote to proteus, “be patient,and you shall marry me.”delighted with these words proteus walked about, flourishing julia\\'sletter and talking to himself.“what have you got there?” asked his father, antonio.“a letter from valentine,” fibbed proteus.“let me read it,” said antonio.“there is no news,” said deceitful proteus; “he only says that he isvery happy, and the duke of milan is kind to him, and that he wishes iwere with him.”this fib had the effect of making antonio think that his son should goto milan and enjoy the favors in which valentine basked. “you must goto-morrow,” he decreed. proteus was dismayed. “give me time to get myoutfit ready.” he was met with the promise, “what you need shall be sentafter you.”it grieved julia to part from her lover before their engagement was twodays\\' old. she gave him a ring, and said, “keep this for my sake,” andhe gave her a ring, and they kissed like two who intend to be true tilldeath. then proteus departed for milan.meanwhile valentine was amusing silvia, whose grey eyes, laughing at himunder auburn hair, had drowned him in love. one day she told him thatshe wanted to write a pretty letter to a gentleman whom she thought wellof, but had no time: would he write it? very much did valentine dislikewriting that letter, but he did write it, and gave it to her coldly.“take it back,” she said; “you did it unwillingly.”“madam,” he said, “it was difficult to write such a letter for you.”“take it back,” she commanded; “you did not write tenderly enough.”valentine was left with the letter, and condemned to write another;but his servant speed saw that, in effect, the lady silvia had allowedvalentine to write for her a love-letter to valentine\\'s own self. “thejoke,” he said, “is as invisible as a weather-cock on a steeple.” hemeant that it was very plain; and he went on to say exactly what it was:“if master will write her love-letters, he must answer them.”on the arrival of proteus, he was introduced by valentine to silvia andafterwards, when they were alone, valentine asked proteus how his lovefor julia was prospering.“why,” said proteus, “you used to get wearied when i spoke of her.”“aye,” confessed valentine, “but it\\'s different now. i can eat and drinkall day with nothing but love on my plate and love in my cup.”“you idolize silvia,” said proteus.“she is divine,” said valentine.“come, come!” remonstrated proteus.“well, if she\\'s not divine,” said valentine, “she is the queen of allwomen on earth.”“except julia,” said proteus.“dear boy,” said valentine, “julia is not excepted; but i will grantthat she alone is worthy to bear my lady\\'s train.”“your bragging astounds me,” said proteus.but he had seen silvia, and he felt suddenly that the yellow-hairedjulia was black in comparison. he became in thought a villain withoutdelay, and said to himself what he had never said before--“i to myselfam dearer than my friend.”it would have been convenient for valentine if proteus had changed, bythe power of the god whose name he bore, the shape of his body at theevil moment when he despised julia in admiring silvia. but his body didnot change; his smile was still affectionate, and valentine confided tohim the great secret that silvia had now promised to run away with him.“in the pocket of this cloak,” said valentine, “i have a silken ropeladder, with hooks which will clasp the window-bar of her room.”proteus knew the reason why silvia and her lover were bent on flight.the duke intended her to wed sir thurio, a gentlemanly noodle for whomshe did not care a straw.proteus thought that if he could get rid of valentine he might makesilvia fond of him, especially if the duke insisted on her enduringsir thurio\\'s tiresome chatter. he therefore went to the duke, and said,“duty before friendship! it grieves me to thwart my friend valentine,but your grace should know that he intends to-night to elope with yourgrace\\'s daughter.” he begged the duke not to tell valentine the giverof this information, and the duke assured him that his name would not bedivulged.early that evening the duke summoned valentine, who came to him wearinga large cloak with a bulging pocket.“you know,” said the duke, “my desire to marry my daughter to sirthurio?”“i do,” replied valentine. “he is virtuous and generous, as befits a manso honored in your grace\\'s thoughts.”“nevertheless she dislikes him,” said the duke. “she is a peevish,proud, disobedient girl, and i should be sorry to leave her a penny. iintend, therefore, to marry again.”valentine bowed.“i hardly know how the young people of to-day make love,” continued theduke, “and i thought that you would be just the man to teach me how towin the lady of my choice.”“jewels have been known to plead rather well,” said valentine.“i have tried them,” said the duke.“the habit of liking the giver may grow if your grace gives her somemore.”“the chief difficulty,” pursued the duke, “is this. the lady is promisedto a young gentleman, and it is hard to have a word with her. she is, infact, locked up.”“then your grace should propose an elopement,” said valentine. “try arope ladder.”“but how should i carry it?” asked the duke.“a rope ladder is light,” said valentine; “you can carry it in a cloak.”“like yours?”“yes, your grace.”“then yours will do. kindly lend it to me.”valentine had talked himself into a trap. he could not refuse to lendhis cloak, and when the duke had donned it, his grace drew from thepocket a sealed missive addressed to silvia. he coolly opened it, andread these words: “silvia, you shall be free to-night.”“indeed,” he said, “and here\\'s the rope ladder. prettily contrived, butnot perfectly. i give you, sir, a day to leave my dominions. if you arein milan by this time to-morrow, you die.”poor valentine was saddened to the core. “unless i look on silvia in theday,” he said, “there is no day for me to look upon.”before he went he took farewell of proteus, who proved a hypocrite ofthe first order. “hope is a lover\\'s staff,” said valentine\\'s betrayer;“walk hence with that.”after leaving milan, valentine and his servant wandered into a forestnear mantua where the great poet virgil lived. in the forest, however,the poets (if any) were brigands, who bade the travelers stand. theyobeyed, and valentine made so good an impression upon his captors thatthey offered him his life on condition that he became their captain.“i accept,” said valentine, “provided you release my servant, and arenot violent to women or the poor.”the reply was worthy of virgil, and valentine became a brigand chief.we return now to julia, who found verona too dull to live in sinceproteus had gone. she begged her maid lucetta to devise a way by whichshe could see him. “better wait for him to return,” said lucetta, andshe talked so sensibly that julia saw it was idle to hope that lucettawould bear the blame of any rash and interesting adventure. juliatherefore said that she intended to go to milan and dressed like a page.“you must cut off your hair then,” said lucetta, who thought that atthis announcement julia would immediately abandon her scheme.“i shall knot it up,” was the disappointing rejoinder.lucetta then tried to make the scheme seem foolish to julia, but juliahad made up her mind and was not to be put off by ridicule; and when hertoilet was completed, she looked as comely a page as one could wish tosee.julia assumed the male name sebastian, and arrived in milan in time tohear music being performed outside the duke\\'s palace.“they are serenading the lady silvia,” said a man to her.suddenly she heard a voice lifted in song, and she knew that voice. itwas the voice of proteus. but what was he singing?   “who is silvia? what is she,      that all our swains commend her?    holy, fair, and wise is she;      the heaven such grace did lend her    that she might admired be.”julia tried not to hear the rest, but these two lines somehow thunderedinto her mind--   “then to silvia let us sing;    she excels each mortal thing.”then proteus thought silvia excelled julia; and, since he sang sobeautifully for all the world to hear, it seemed that he was not onlyfalse to julia, but had forgotten her. yet julia still loved him. sheeven went to him, and asked to be his page, and proteus engaged her.one day, he handed to her the ring which she had given him, and said,“sebastian, take that to the lady silvia, and say that i should like thepicture of her she promised me.”silvia had promised the picture, but she disliked proteus. she wasobliged to talk to him because he was high in the favor of her father,who thought he pleaded with her on behalf of sir thurio. silvia hadlearned from valentine that proteus was pledged to a sweetheart inverona; and when he said tender things to her, she felt that he wasdisloyal in friendship as well as love.julia bore the ring to silvia, but silvia said, “i will not wrong thewoman who gave it him by wearing it.”“she thanks you,” said julia.“you know her, then?” said silvia, and julia spoke so tenderly ofherself that silvia wished that sebastian would marry julia.silvia gave julia her portrait for proteus, who would have received itthe worse for extra touches on the nose and eyes if julia had not madeup her mind that she was as pretty as silvia.soon there was an uproar in the palace. silvia had fled.the duke was certain that her intention was to join the exiledvalentine, and he was not wrong.without delay he started in pursuit, with sir thurio, proteus, and someservants.the members of the pursuing party got separated, and proteus and julia(in her page\\'s dress) were by themselves when they saw silvia, who hadbeen taken prisoner by outlaws and was now being led to their captain.proteus rescued her, and then said, “i have saved you from death; giveme one kind look.”“o misery, to be helped by you!” cried silvia. “i would rather be alion\\'s breakfast.”julia was silent, but cheerful. proteus was so much annoyed with silviathat he threatened her, and seized her by the waist.“o heaven!” cried silvia.at that instant there was a noise of crackling branches. valentine camecrashing through the mantuan forest to the rescue of his beloved. juliafeared he would slay proteus, and hurried to help her false lover. buthe struck no blow, he only said, “proteus, i am sorry i must never trustyou more.”thereat proteus felt his guilt, and fell on his knees, saying, “forgiveme! i grieve! i suffer!”“then you are my friend once more,” said the generous valentine. “ifsilvia, that is lost to me, will look on you with favor, i promise thati will stand aside and bless you both.”these words were terrible to julia, and she swooned. valentine revivedher, and said, “what was the matter, boy?”“i remembered,” fibbed julia, “that i was charged to give a ring to thelady silvia, and that i did not.”“well, give it to me,” said proteus.she handed him a ring, but it was the ring that proteus gave to juliabefore he left verona.proteus looked at her hand, and crimsoned to the roots of his hair.“i changed my shape when you changed your mind,” said she.“but i love you again,” said he.just then outlaws entered, bringing two prizes--the duke and sir thurio.“forbear!” cried valentine, sternly. “the duke is sacred.”sir thurio exclaimed, “there\\'s silvia; she\\'s mine!”“touch her, and you die!” said valentine.“i should be a fool to risk anything for her,” said sir thurio.“then you are base,” said the duke. “valentine, you are a brave man.your banishment is over. i recall you. you may marry silvia. you deserveher.”“i thank your grace,” said valentine, deeply moved, “and yet must askyou one more boon.”“i grant it,” said the duke.“pardon these men, your grace, and give them employment. they are betterthan their calling.”“i pardon them and you,” said the duke. “their work henceforth shall befor wages.”“what think you of this page, your grace?” asked valentine, indicatingjulia.the duke glanced at her, and said, “i think the boy has grace in him.”“more grace than boy, say i,” laughed valentine, and the only punishmentwhich proteus had to bear for his treacheries against love andfriendship was the recital in his presence of the adventures ofjulia-sebastian of verona.all\\'s well that ends wellin the year thirteen hundred and something, the countess of rousillonwas unhappy in her palace near the pyrenees. she had lost her husband,and the king of france had summoned her son bertram to paris, hundredsof miles away.bertram was a pretty youth with curling hair, finely arched eyebrows,and eyes as keen as a hawk\\'s. he was as proud as ignorance could makehim, and would lie with a face like truth itself to gain a selfish end.but a pretty youth is a pretty youth, and helena was in love with him.helena was the daughter of a great doctor who had died in the serviceof the count of rousillon. her sole fortune consisted in a few of herfather\\'s prescriptions.when bertram had gone, helena\\'s forlorn look was noticed by thecountess, who told her that she was exactly the same to her as herown child. tears then gathered in helena\\'s eyes, for she felt that thecountess made bertram seem like a brother whom she could never marry.the countess guessed her secret forthwith, and helena confessed thatbertram was to her as the sun is to the day.she hoped, however, to win this sun by earning the gratitude of the kingof france, who suffered from a lingering illness, which made him lame.the great doctors attached to the court despaired of curing him, buthelena had confidence in a prescription which her father had used withsuccess.taking an affectionate leave of the countess, she went to paris, and wasallowed to see the king.he was very polite, but it was plain he thought her a quack. “it wouldnot become me,” he said, “to apply to a simple maiden for the reliefwhich all the learned doctors cannot give me.”“heaven uses weak instruments sometimes,” said helena, and she declaredthat she would forfeit her life if she failed to make him well.“and if you succeed?” questioned the king.“then i will ask your majesty to give me for a husband the man whom ichoose!”so earnest a young lady could not be resisted forever by a sufferingking. helena, therefore, became the king\\'s doctor, and in two days theroyal cripple could skip.he summoned his courtiers, and they made a glittering throng in thethrone room of his palace. well might the country girl have beendazzled, and seen a dozen husbands worth dreaming of among the handsomeyoung noblemen before her. but her eyes only wandered till they foundbertram. then she went up to him, and said, “i dare not say i take you,but i am yours!” raising her voice that the king might hear, she added,“this is the man!”“bertram,” said the king, “take her; she\\'s your wife!”“my wife, my liege?” said bertram. “i beg your majesty to permit me tochoose a wife.”“do you know, bertram, what she has done for your king?” asked themonarch, who had treated bertram like a son.“yes, your majesty,” replied bertram; “but why should i marry a girl whoowes her breeding to my father\\'s charity?”“you disdain her for lacking a title, but i can give her a title,” saidthe king; and as he looked at the sulky youth a thought came to him, andhe added, “strange that you think so much of blood when you could notdistinguish your own from a beggar\\'s if you saw them mixed together in abowl.”“i cannot love her,” asserted bertram; and helena said gently, “urgehim not, your majesty. i am glad to have cured my king for my country\\'ssake.”“my honor requires that scornful boy\\'s obedience,” said the king.“bertram, make up your mind to this. you marry this lady, of whom youare so unworthy, or you learn how a king can hate. your answer?”bertram bowed low and said, “your majesty has ennobled the lady by yourinterest in her. i submit.”“take her by the band,” said the king, “and tell her she is yours.”bertram obeyed, and with little delay he was married to helena.fear of the king, however, could not make him a lover. ridicule helpedto sour him. a base soldier named parolles told him to his face thatnow he had a “kicky-wicky” his business was not to fight but to stayat home. “kicky-wicky” was only a silly epithet for a wife, but it madebertram feel he could not bear having a wife, and that he must go to thewar in italy, though the king had forbidden him.helena he ordered to take leave of the king and return to rousillon,giving her letters for his mother and herself. he then rode off, biddingher a cold good-bye.she opened the letter addressed to herself, and read, “when you can getthe ring from my finger you can call me husband, but against that \\'when\\'i write \\'never.\\'”dry-eyed had helena been when she entered the king\\'s presence and saidfarewell, but he was uneasy on her account, and gave her a ring fromhis own finger, saying, “if you send this to me, i shall know you are introuble, and help you.”she did not show him bertram\\'s letter to his wife; it would have madehim wish to kill the truant count; but she went back to rousillon andhanded her mother-in-law the second letter. it was short and bitter. “ihave run away,” it said. “if the world be broad enough, i will be alwaysfar away from her.”“cheer up,” said the noble widow to the deserted wife. “i wash his nameout of my blood, and you alone are my child.”the dowager countess, however, was still mother enough to bertram to laythe blame of his conduct on parolles, whom she called “a very taintedfellow.”helena did not stay long at rousillon. she clad herself as a pilgrim,and, leaving a letter for her mother-in-law, secretly set out forflorence.on entering that city she inquired of a woman the way to the pilgrims\\'house of rest, but the woman begged “the holy pilgrim” to lodge withher.helena found that her hostess was a widow, who had a beautiful daughternamed diana.when diana heard that helena came from france, she said, “a countrymanof yours, count rousillon, has done worthy service for florence.” butafter a time, diana had something to tell which was not at all worthy ofhelena\\'s husband. bertram was making love to diana. he did not hide thefact that he was married, but diana heard from parolles that his wifewas not worth caring for.the widow was anxious for diana\\'s sake, and helena decided to inform herthat she was the countess rousillon.“he keeps asking diana for a lock of her hair,” said the widow.helena smiled mournfully, for her hair was as fine as diana\\'s and of thesame color. then an idea struck her, and she said, “take this purse ofgold for yourself. i will give diana three thousand crowns if she willhelp me to carry out this plan. let her promise to give a lock of herhair to my husband if he will give her the ring which he wears on hisfinger. it is an ancestral ring. five counts of rousillon have worn it,yet he will yield it up for a lock of your daughter\\'s hair. let yourdaughter insist that he shall cut the lock of hair from her in a darkroom, and agree in advance that she shall not speak a single word.”the widow listened attentively, with the purse of gold in her lap. shesaid at last, “i consent, if diana is willing.”diana was willing, and, strange to say, the prospect of cutting offa lock of hair from a silent girl in a dark room was so pleasing tobertram that he handed diana his ring, and was told when to follow herinto the dark room. at the time appointed he came with a sharp knife,and felt a sweet face touch his as he cut off the lock of hair, and heleft the room satisfied, like a man who is filled with renown, and onhis finger was a ring which the girl in the dark room had given him.the war was nearly over, but one of its concluding chapters taughtbertram that the soldier who had been impudent enough to call helena his“kicky-wicky” was far less courageous than a wife. parolles was sucha boaster, and so fond of trimings to his clothes, that the frenchofficers played him a trick to discover what he was made of. he had losthis drum, and had said that he would regain it unless he was killed inthe attempt. his attempt was a very poor one, and he was inventing thestory of a heroic failure, when he was surrounded and disarmed.“portotartarossa,” said a french lord.“what horrible lingo is this?” thought parolles, who had beenblindfolded.“he\\'s calling for the tortures,” said a french man, affecting to act asinterpreter. “what will you say without \\'em?”“as much,” replied parolles, “as i could possibly say if you pinched melike a pasty.” he was as good as his word. he told them how many therewere in each regiment of the florentine army, and he refreshed them withspicy anecdotes of the officers commanding it.bertram was present, and heard a letter read, in which parolles tolddiana that he was a fool.“this is your devoted friend,” said a french lord.“he is a cat to me now,” said bertram, who detested our hearthrug pets.parolles was finally let go, but henceforth he felt like a sneak, andwas not addicted to boasting.we now return to france with helena, who had spread a report of herdeath, which was conveyed to the dowager countess at rousillon by lafeu,a lord who wished to marry his daughter magdalen to bertram.the king mourned for helena, but he approved of the marriage proposedfor bertram, and paid a visit to rousillon in order to see itaccomplished.“his great offense is dead,” he said. “let bertram approach me.”then bertram, scarred in the cheek, knelt before his sovereign, and saidthat if he had not loved lafeu\\'s daughter before he married helena, hewould have prized his wife, whom he now loved when it was too late.“love that is late offends the great sender,” said the king. “forgetsweet helena, and give a ring to magdalen.”bertram immediately gave a ring to lafeu, who said indignantly, “it\\'shelena\\'s!”“it\\'s not!” said bertram.hereupon the king asked to look at the ring, and said, “this is the ringi gave to helena, and bade her send to me if ever she needed help. soyou had the cunning to get from her what could help her most.”bertram denied again that the ring was helena\\'s, but even his mothersaid it was.“you lie!” exclaimed the king. “seize him, guards!” but even while theywere seizing him, bertram wondered how the ring, which he thought dianahad given him, came to be so like helena\\'s. a gentleman now entered,craving permission to deliver a petition to the king. it was a petitionsigned diana capilet, and it begged that the king would order bertram tomarry her whom he had deserted after winning her love.“i\\'d sooner buy a son-in-law at a fair than take bertram now,” saidlafeu.“admit the petitioner,” said the king.bertram found himself confronted by diana and her mother. he deniedthat diana had any claim on him, and spoke of her as though her life wasspent in the gutter. but she asked him what sort of gentlewoman itwas to whom he gave, as to her he gave, the ring of his ancestors nowmissing from his finger?bertram was ready to sink into the earth, but fate had one crowninggenerosity reserved for him. helena entered.“do i see reality?” asked the king.“o pardon! pardon!” cried bertram.she held up his ancestral ring. “now that i have this,” said she, “willyou love me, bertram?”“to the end of my life,” cried he.“my eyes smell onions,” said lafeu. tears for helena were twinkling inthem.the king praised diana when he was fully informed by that not very shyyoung lady of the meaning of her conduct. for helena\\'s sake she hadwished to expose bertram\\'s meanness, not only to the king, but tohimself. his pride was now in shreds, and it is believed that he made ahusband of some sort after all.pronouncing vocabulary of names.

-- ii. 1.    that, sir, which serves and seeks for gain,       and follows but for form,    will pack, when it begins to rain,       and leave thee in the storm.        king lear -- ii. 4.    ah! when the means are gone, that buy this praise,    the breath is gone whereof this praise is made:    feast won--fast lost; one cloud of winter showers,    these flies are couched.        timon of athens -- ii. 2.advice to a son leaving home.    give thy thoughts no tongue,    nor any unproportioned thought his act    be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.    the friends thou hast, and their adoption tried    grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;    but do not dull thy palm with entertainment    of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. beware    of entrance to a quarrel: but, being in,    bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.    give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:    take each man\\'s censure, but reserve thy judgment,    costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,    but not expressed in fancy: rich, not gaudy:    for the apparel oft proclaims the man;    and they in france, of the best rank and station,    are most select and generous, chief in that.    neither a borrower, nor a lender be:    for loan oft loses both itself and friend;    and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.    this above all.--to thine ownself be true;    and it must follow, as the night the day,    thou canst not then be false to any man.        hamlet -- i. 3.age.    my may of life is    fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:    and that which should accompany old age,    as honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,    i must not look to have; but, in their stead,    curses not loud, but deep, mouth-honor, breath,    which the poor heart would feign deny, but dare not.        macbeth -- v. 3.ambition.    dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. and i    hold ambition of so airy and light a quality, that it is but    a shadow\\'s shadow.        hamlet -- ii 2.    i charge thee fling away ambition;    by that sin fell the angels, how can man then,    the image of his maker, hope to win by \\'t?    love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;    corruption wins not more than honesty.    still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,    to silence envious tongues. be just, and fear not!    let all the ends, thou aim\\'st at, be thy country\\'s,    thy god\\'s, and truth\\'s.        king henry viii. -- iii. 2.anger.    anger is like    a full-hot horse, who being allowed his way,    self-mettle tires him.        king henry viii. -- i. 1.arrogance.    there are a sort of men, whose visages    do cream and mantle like a standing pond,    and do a willful stillness entertain,    with purpose to be dressed in an opinion    of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,    as who should say, “i am sir oracle,    and when i ope my lips, let no dog bark!”     o! my antonio, i do know of these    that therefore are reputed wise    for saying nothing, when, i am sure,    if they should speak, would almost dam those ears,    which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.        the merchant of venice -- i. 1.authority.    thou hast seen a farmer\\'s dog bark at a beggar?    and the creature run from the cur?    there thou might\\'st behold the great image of authority    a dog\\'s obeyed in office.        king lear -- iv. 6.    could great men thunder    as jove himself does, jove would ne\\'er be quiet,    for every pelting, petty officer    would use his heaven for thunder: nothing but thunder--    merciful heaven!    thou rather, with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,    splitt\\'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak,    than the soft myrtle!--o, but man, proud man!    drest in a little brief authority --    most ignorant of what he\\'s most assured,    his glassy essence,--like an angry ape,    plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,    as make the angels weep.        measure for measure -- ii. 2.beauty.    the hand, that hath made you fair, hath made you good: the    goodness, that is cheap in beauty, makes beauty brief in goodness;    but grace, being the soul of your complexion, should keep the body    of it ever fair.        measure for measure -- iii. 1.blessings undervalued.    it so falls out    that what we have we prize not to the worth,    whiles we enjoy it; but being lacked and lost,    why, then we rack the value; then we find    the virtue, that possession would not show us    whiles it was ours.        much ado about nothing -- iv. 1.braggarts.    it will come to pass,    that every braggart shall be found an ass.        all\\'s well that ends well -- iv. 3.    they that have the voice of lions, and the act of bares,    are they not monsters?        troilus and cressida -- iii. 2.calumny.    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,    thou shalt not escape calumny.        hamlet -- iii. 1.    no might nor greatness in mortality    can censure \\'scape; back-wounding calumny    the whitest virtue strikes. what king so strong,    can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?        measure for measure -- iii. 2.ceremony.    ceremony    was but devised at first, to set a gloss    on faint deeds, hollow welcomes.    recanting goodness, sorry ere \\'tis shown;    but where there is true friendship, there needs none.        timon of athens -- i. 2.comfort.    men    can counsel, and speak comfort to that grief    which they themselves not feel; but tasting it,    their counsel turns to passion, which before    would give preceptial medicine to rage,    fetter strong madness in a silken thread,    charm ache with air, and agony with words:    no, no; \\'tis all men\\'s office to speak patience    to those that wring under the load of sorrow;    but no man\\'s virtue, nor sufficiency,    to be so moral, when he shall endure    the like himself.        much ado about nothing -- v. 1.    well, every one can master a grief, but he that has it.        idem -- ii.comparison.    when the moon shone, we did not see the candle.    so doth the greater glory dim the less;    a substitute shines brightly as a king,    until a king be by; and then his state    empties itself, as does an inland brook    into the main of waters.        merchant of venice -- v. 1.conscience.    thus conscience does make cowards of us all;    and thus the native hue of resolution    is sicklied o\\'er with the pale cast of thought;    and enterprises of great pith and moment,    with this regard, their currents turn awry,    and lose the name of action.        hamlet -- iii. 1.content.    my crown is in my heart, not on my head;    not decked with diamonds and indian stones,    nor to be seen; my crown is called “content;”     a crown it is, that seldom kings enjoy.        king henry vi., part 3d - iii. 1.contention.    how, in one house,    should many people, under two commands,    hold amity?        king lear -- ii. 4.    when two authorities are set up,    neither supreme, how soon confusion    may enter twixt the gap of both, and take    the one by the other.        coriolanus -- iii. 1.contentment.    \\'tis better to be lowly born,    and range with humble livers in content,    than to be perked up in a glistering grief,    and wear a golden sorrow.        king henry viii. -- ii. 3.cowards.    cowards die many times before their deaths;    the valiant never taste of death but once.        julius caesar -- ii. 2.custom.    that monster, custom, who all sense doth eat    of habit\\'s devil, is angel yet in this:    that to the use of actions fair and good    he likewise gives a frock, or livery,    that aptly is put on: refrain to-night:    and that shall lend a kind of easiness    to the next abstinence: the next more easy:    for use almost can change the stamp of nature,    and either curb the devil, or throw him out    with wondrous potency.        hamlet -- iii. 4.    a custom    more honored in the breach, then the observance.        idem -- i. 4.death.    kings, and mightiest potentates, must die;    for that\\'s the end of human misery.        king henry vi., part 1st -- iii. 2.    of all the wonders that i yet have heard,    it seems to me most strange that men should fear;    seeing that death, a necessary end,    will come, when it will come.        julius caesar -- ii. 2.    the dread of something after death,    makes us rather bear those ills we have,    than fly to others we know not of.        hamlet -- iii. 1.    the sense of death is most in apprehension.        measure for measure -- iii. 1.    by medicine life may be prolonged, yet death    will seize the doctor too.        cymbeline -- v. 5.deception.    the devil can cite scripture for his purpose.    an evil soul, producing holy witness,    is like a villain with a smiling cheek;    a goodly apple rotten at the heart;    o, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!        merchant of venice -- i. 3.deeds.    foul deeds will rise,    though all the earth o\\'erwhelm them to men\\'s eyes.        hamlet -- i. 2.    how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds,    makes deeds ill done!        king john -- iv. 2.delay.    that we would do,    we should do when we would; for this would changes,    and hath abatements and delays as many,    as there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;    and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh,    that hurts by easing.        hamlet -- iv. 7.delusion.    for love of grace,    lay not that flattering unction to your soul;    it will but skin and film the ulcerous place;    whiles rank corruption, mining all within,    infects unseen.        hamlet -- iii. 4.discretion.    let\\'s teach ourselves that honorable stop,    not to outsport discretion.        othello -- ii. 3.doubts and fears.    i am cabin\\'d, cribb\\'d, confined, bound in    to saucy doubts and fears.        macbeth -- iii. 4.drunkenness.    boundless intemperance.    in nature is a tyranny; it hath been    th\\' untimely emptying of the happy throne,    and fall of many kings.        measure for measure -- i. 3.duty owing to ourselves and others.    love all, trust a few,    do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy    rather in power, than use; and keep thy friend    under thy own life\\'s key; be checked for silence,    but never taxed for speech.        all\\'s well that ends well -- i. 1.equivocation.    but yet    i do not like but yet, it does allay    the good precedence; fye upon but yet:    but yet is as a gailer to bring forth    some monstrous malefactor.        antony and cleopatra -- ii. 5.excess.    a surfeit of the sweetest things    the deepest loathing to the stomach brings.        midsummer night\\'s dream -- ii. 3.    every inordinate cup is unblessed,    and the ingredient is a devil.        othello -- ii. 3.falsehood.    falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,    three things that women hold in hate.        two gentlemen of verona -- iii. 2.fear.    fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds    where it should guard.        king henry vi., part 2d -- v. 2.    fear, and be slain; no worse can come, to fight:    and fight and die, is death destroying death;    where fearing dying, pays death servile breath.        king richard ii. -- iii. 2.feasts.    small cheer, and great welcome, makes a merry feast.        comedy of errors -- iii. 1.filial ingratitude.    ingratitude!  thou marble-hearted fiend,    more hideous, when thou showest thee in a child,    than the sea-monster.        king lear -- i. 4.    how sharper than a serpent\\'s tooth it is    to have a thankless child        idem -- i. 4.forethought.    determine on some course,    more than a wild exposure to each cause    that starts i\\' the way before thee.        coriolanus -- iv. 1.fortitude.    yield not thy neck    to fortune\\'s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind    still ride in triumph over all mischance.        king henry vi., part 3d -- iii. 3.fortune.    when fortune means to men most good,    she looks upon them with a threatening eye.        king john -- iii. 4.greatness.    farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!    this is the state of man: to-day he puts forth    the tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms,    and bears his blushing honors thick upon him;    the third day, comes a frost, a killing frost;    and,--when he thinks, good easy man, full surely    his greatness is ripening,--nips his root,    and then he falls, as i do.        king henry viii. -- iii. 2.    some are born great, some achieve greatness,    and some have greatness thrust upon them.        twelfth night -- ii. 5.happiness.    o, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness    through another man\\'s eyes.        as you like it -- v. 2.honesty.    an honest man is able to speak for himself,    when a knave is not.        king henry vi., part 2d -- v. 1.    to be honest, as this world goes, is to be    one man picked out of ten thousand.        hamlet -- ii. 2.hypocrisy.    devils soonest tempt,    resembling spirits of light.        love\\'s labor lost -- iv. 3.    one may smile, and smile,             and be a villain.        hamlet -- i. 5.innocence.    the trust i have is in mine innocence,    and therefore am i bold and resolute.        troilus and cressida -- iv. 4.insinuations.    the shrug, the hum, or ha; these petty brands,    that calumny doth use;--                            for calumny will sear    virtue itself:--these shrugs, these bums, and ha\\'s,    when you have said, she\\'s goodly, come between,    ere you can say she\\'s honest.        winter\\'s tale -- ii. 1.jealousy.    trifles, light as air,    are, to the jealous, confirmations strong    as proofs of holy writ.        othello -- iii. 3.    o beware of jealousy:    it is the green-eyed monster, which does mock    the meat it feeds on.        idem.jests.    a jest\\'s prosperity lies in the ear    of him that hears it.        love\\'s labor lost -- v. 2.    he jests at scars,    that never felt a wound.        romeo and juliet -- ii. 2.judgment.    heaven is above all; there sits a judge,    that no king can corrupt.        king henry viii, -- iii. 1.life.    life\\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player,    that struts and frets his hour upon the stage,    and then is heard no more: it is a tale    told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,    signifying nothing.        macbeth -- v. 5.    we are such stuff    as dreams are made of, and our little life    is rounded with a sleep.        the tempest -- iv. 1.love.    a murd\\'rous, guilt shows not itself more soon,    than love that would seem bid: love\\'s night is noon.        twelfth night -- iii. 2.    sweet love, changing his property,    turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.        king richard ii. -- iii. 2.    when love begins to sicken and decay,    it useth an enforced ceremony.        julius caesar -- ii. 2.    the course of true-love    never did run smooth.        midsummer night\\'s dream -- i. 1.    love looks not with the eyes,    but with the mind.        idem.    she never told her love,--    but let concealment, like a worm i\\' th\\' bud,    feed on her damask check: she pined in thought    and, with a green and yellow melancholy,    she sat like patience on a monument,    smiling at grief. was not this love indeed?        twelfth night -- ii. 4.    but love is blind, and lovers cannot see    the pretty follies that themselves commit.        the merchant of venice -- ii. 6.man.    what a piece of work is man!  how noble in reason!    how infinite in faculties! in form, and moving,    how express and admirable! in  action, how like    an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the    beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!        hamlet -- ii. 2.mercy.    the quality of mercy is not strained:    it droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven,    upon the place beneath: it is twice bless\\'d;    it blesses him that gives, and him that takes:    \\'tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes    the throned monarch better than his crown:    his scepter shows the force of temporal power,    the attribute to awe and majesty,    wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;    but mercy is above this sceptered sway;    it is enthroned in the hearts of kings;    it is an attribute to god himself;    and earthly power doth then show likest god\\'s,    when mercy seasons justice.                                consider this,--    that, in the course of justice, none of us    should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;    and that same prayer doth teach us all to render    the deeds of mercy.        merchant of venice -- iv. 1.merit.    who shall go about    to cozen fortune, and be honorable    without the stamp of merit!  let none presume    to wear an undeserved dignity.        merchant of venice -- ii. 9.modesty.    it is the witness still of excellency,    to put a strange face on his own perfection.        much ado about nothing -- ii. 3.moral conquest.    brave conquerors! for so you are,    that war against your own affections,    and the huge army of the world\\'s desires.        love\\'s labor\\'s lost  -- i. 1.murder.    the great king of kings    hath in the table of his law commanded,    that thou shalt do no murder.    take heed; for he holds vengeance in his band,    to hurl upon their heads thatbreak his law.        king richard iii. -- i. 4.    blood, like sacrificing abel\\'s, cries,    even from the tongueless caverns of the earth.        king richard ii. -- i. 1.music.    the man that hath no music in himself,    nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,    is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;    the motions of his spirit are dull as night,    and his affections dark as erebus:    let no such man be trusted.        merchant of venice -- v. 1.names.    what\\'s in a name? that, which we call a rose,    by any other name would smell as sweet.        romeo and juliet -- ii. 2.    good name, in man, and woman,    is the immediate jewel of their souls:    who steals my purse steals trash; \\'tis something, nothing.    \\'twas mine, \\'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:    but he, that filches from me my good name,    robs me of that, which not enriches him,    and makes me poor indeed.        othello -- iii. 3.nature.    one touch of nature makes the whole world kin.        troilus and cressida -- iii. 3.news, good and bad.    though it be honest, it is never good    to bring bad news. give to a gracious message    an host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell    themselves, when they be felt.        antony and cleopatra -- ii. 5.office.    \\'tis the curse of service;    preferment goes by letter, and affection,    not by the old gradation, where each second    stood heir to the first.        othello -- i. 1.opportunity.    who seeks, and will not take when offered,    shall never find it more.        antony and cleopatra -- ii. 7.    there is a tide in the affairs of men,    which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;    omitted, all the voyage of their life    is bound in shallows, and in miseries:    and we must take the current when it serves,    or lose our ventures.        julius caesar -- iv. 3.oppression.    press not a falling man too far; \\'tis virtue:    his faults lie open to the laws; let them,    not you, correct them.        king henry viii. -- iii. 2.past and future.    o thoughts of men accurst!    past, and to come, seem best; things present, worst.        king henry iv., part 2d -- i. 3.patience.    how poor are they, that have not patience!--    what wound did ever heal, but by degrees?        othello -- ii. 3.peace.    a peace is of the nature of a conquest;    for then both parties nobly are subdued,    and neither party loser.    king henry iv., part 2d -- iv. 2.    i will use the olive with my sword:    make war breed peace; make peace stint war; make each    prescribe to other, as each other\\'s leech.        timon of athens -- v. 5.    i know myself now; and i feel within me    a peace above all earthly dignities,    a still and quiet conscience.        king henry viii. -- iii. 2.penitence.    who by repentance is not satisfied,    is nor of heaven, nor earth; for these are pleased;    by penitence the eternal\\'s wrath appeased.        two gentlemen of verona -- v. 4.players.    all the world\\'s a stage,    and all the men and women merely players:    they have their exits and their entrances;    and one man in his time plays many parts.        as you like it -- ii. 7.    there be players, that i have seen play,--    and heard others praise, and that highly,--    not to speak it profanely, that,    neither having the accent of christians,    nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man,    have so strutted, and bellowed,    that i have thought some of nature\\'s journeymen    had made men and not made them well,    they imitated humanity so abominably.        hamlet -- iii. 2.pomp.    why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?    and, live we how we can, yet die we must.        king henry v. part 3d -- v. 2.precept and practice.    if to do were as easy as to know what were good    to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men\\'s    cottages princes\\' palaces. it is a good divine that    follows his own instructions: i can easier teach    twenty what were good to be done, than be one of    twenty to follow mine own teaching. the brain may    devise laws for the blood; but a hot temper leaps    o\\'er a cold decree: such a bare is madness, the    youth, to skip o\\'er the meshes of good counsel,    the cripple.        the merchant of venice -- i. 2.princes and titles.    princes have but their titles for their glories,    an outward honor for an inward toil;    and, for unfelt imaginations,    they often feel a world of restless cares:    so that, between their titles, and low name,    there\\'s nothing differs but the outward fame.        king richard iii. -- i. 4.quarrels.    in a false quarrel these is no true valor.        much ado about nothing -- v. 1.    thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just;    and he but naked, though locked up in steel,    whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.        king henry vi., part 2d -- iii. 2.rage.    men in rage strike those that wish them best.        othello -- ii. 3.repentance.    men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,    which after-hours give leisure to repent.        king richard iii. -- iv. 4.reputation.    the purest treasure mortal times afford,    is--spotless reputation; that away,    men are but gilded loam, or painted clay.    a jewel in a ten-times-barred-up chest    i-- a bold spirit in a loyal breast.        king richard ii. -- i. 1.retribution.    the gods are just, and of our pleasant vices    make instruments to scourge us.        king lear -- v. s.    if these men have defeated the law,    and outrun native punishment,    though they can outstrip men,    they have no wings to fly from god.        king henry v. -- iv. 1.scars.    a sear nobly got, or a noble scar,    is a good livery of honor.        all\\'s well that ends well -- iv. 6.    to such as boasting show their scars,    a mock is due.        troilus and cressida -- iv. 5.self-conquest.    better conquest never can\\'st thou make,    than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts    against those giddy loose suggestions.        king john -- iii. 1.self-exertion.    men at some time are masters of their fates;       the fault is not in our stars,    but in ourselves.        julius caesar -- i. 2.self-reliance.    our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,    which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky    gives us free scope; only, doth backward pull    our slow designs, when we ourselves are dull.        all\\'s well that ends well -- i. 1.silence.    out of this silence, yet i picked a welcome;    and in the modesty of fearful duty    i read as much, as from the rattling tongue    of saucy and audacious eloquence.        midsummer night\\'s dream -- v. 1.    the silence often of pure innocence    persuades, when speaking fails.        winter\\'s tale -- ii. 2.    silence is the perfectest herald of joy:    i were but little happy, if i could say how much.        much ado about nothing -- ii. 1.slander.    slander,    whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue    outvenoms all the worms of nile; whose breath    rides on the posting winds, and doth belie    all corners of the world; kings, queens, and states,    maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave,    this viperous slander enters.        cymbeline -- iii. 4.sleep.    the innocent sleep;    sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care,    the death of each day\\'s life, sore labor\\'s bath,    balm of hurt minds, great nature\\'s second course,    chief nourisher in life\\'s feast.        macbeth -- ii. 2.suicide.    against self-slaughter    there is a prohibition so divine,    that cravens my weak hand.        cymbeline -- iii. 4.temperance.    though i look old, yet am i strong and lusty:    for in my youth i never did apply    hot and rebellious liquors in my blood;    nor did not with unbashful forehead woo    the means of weakness and debility:    therefore my age is as a lusty winter,    frosty, but kindly.        as you like it -- ii. 3.theory and practice.    there was never yet philosopher,    that could endure the tooth-ache patiently;    however, they have writ the style of the gods,    and made a pish at chance and sufferance.        much ado about nothing -- v. 1.treachery.    though those, that are betrayed,    do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor    stands in worse case of woe.        cymbeline -- iii. 4.valor.    the better part of valor is--discretion.        king henry iv., part 1st -- v. 4.    when valor preys on reason,    it eats the sword it fights with.        antony and cleopatra -- iii. 2.    what valor were it, when a cur doth grin    for one to thrust his band between his teeth,    when he might spurn him with his foot away?        king henry vi., part 1st -- i. 4.war.    take care    how you awake the sleeping sword of war:    we charge you in the name of god, take heed.        king henry iv., part 1st -- i. 2.welcome.    welcome ever smiles,    and farewell goes out sighing.        troilus and cressida -- iii. 3.wine.    good wine is a good familiar creature,    if it be well used.        othello -- ii. 3.    o thou invisible spirit of wine,    if thou hast no name to be known by,    let us call thee --devil!. . .  o, that    men should put an enemy in their mouths,    to steal away their brains!    that we should with joy, revel,    pleasure, and applause,    transform ourselves into beasts!        othello -- ii. 3.woman.    a woman impudent and mannish grown    is not more loathed than an effeminate man.        troilus and cressida -- iii. 3.words.    words without thoughts    never to heaven go.        hamlet -- iii. 3.    few words shall fit the trespass best,    where no excuse can give the fault amending.        troilus and cressida -- iii. 2.worldly care.    you have too much respect upon the world:    they lose it, that do buy it with much care.        merchant of venice -- i. 1.worldly honors.    not a man, for being simply man,    hath any honor; but honor for those honors    that are without him, as place, riches, favor,    prizes of accident as oftas merit;    which when they fall, as being slippery standers,    the love that leaned on them, as slippery too,    do one pluck down another, and together    die in the fall. but \\'tis not so with me.        troilus

well-dealing countrymen,who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,excludes all pity from our threatening looks.                       10for, since the mortal and intestine jars’twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,it hath in solemn synods been decreed,both by the syracusians and ourselves,to admit no traffic to our adverse towns:                           15nay, more,if any born at ephesus be seenat any syracusian marts and fairs;again: if any syracusian borncome to the bay of ephesus, he dies,                                20his goods

              25therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die._æge._ yet this my comfort: when your words are done,my woes end likewise with the evening sun._duke._ well, syracusian, say, in brief, the causewhy thou departed’st from thy native home,                          30and for what cause thou camest to ephesus._æge._ a heavier task could not have been imposedthan i to speak my griefs unspeakable:yet, that the world may witness that my endwas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,                         35i’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.in syracusa was i born; and wedunto a woman, happy but for me,and by me, had not our hap been bad.with her i lived in joy; our wealth increased                       40by prosperous voyages i often madeto epidamnum; till my factor’s death,and the great care of goods at random left,drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:from whom my absence was not six months old,                        45before herself, almost at fainting underthe pleasing punishment that women bear,had made provision for her following me,and soon and safe arrived where i was.there had she not been long but she became                          50a joyful mother of two goodly sons;and, which was strange, the one so like the otheras could not be distinguish’d but by names.that very hour, and in the self-same inn,a meaner woman was delivered                                        55of such a burden, male twins, both alike:those, for their parents were exceeding poor,i bought, and brought up to attend my sons.my wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,made daily motions for our home return:                             60unwilling i agreed; alas! too soonwe came aboard.a league from epidamnum had we sail’d,before the always-wind-obeying deepgave any tragic instance of our harm:                               65but longer did we not retain much hope;for what obscured light the heavens did grantdid but convey unto our fearful mindsa doubtful warrant of immediate death;which though myself would gladly have embraced,                     70yet the incessant weepings of my wife,weeping before for what she saw must come,and piteous plainings of the pretty babes,that mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,forced me to seek delays for them and me.                           75and this it was, for other means was none:the sailors sought for safety by our boat,and left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:my wife, more careful for the latter-born,had fasten’d him unto a small spare mast,                           80such as seafaring men provide for storms;to him one of the other twins was bound,whilst i had been like heedful of the other:the children thus disposed, my wife and i,fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,                         85fasten’d ourselves at either end the mast;and floating straight, obedient to the stream,was carried towards corinth, as we thought.at length the sun, gazing upon the earth,dispersed those vapours that offended us;                           90and, by the benefit of his wished light,the seas wax’d calm, and we discoveredtwo ships from far making amain to us,of corinth that, of epidaurus this:but ere they came,--o, let me say no more!                          95gather the sequel by that went before._duke._ nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;for we may pity, though not pardon thee._æge._ o, had the gods done so, i had not nowworthily term’d them merciless to us!                              100for, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,we were encounter’d by a mighty rock;which being violently borne upon,our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;so that, in this unjust divorce of us,                             105fortune had left to both of us alikewhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.her part, poor soul! seeming as burdenedwith lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,was carried with more speed before the wind;                       110and in our sight they three were taken upby fishermen of corinth, as we thought.at length, another ship had seized on us;and, knowing whom it was their hap to save,gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck’d guests;                115and would have reft the fishers of their prey,had not their bark been very slow of sail;and therefore homeward did they bend their course.thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss;that by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,                         120to tell sad stories of my own mishaps._duke._ and, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,do me the favour to dilate at fullwhat hath befall’n of them and thee till now._æge._ my youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,                    125at eighteen years became inquisitiveafter his brother: and importuned methat his attendant--so his case was like,reft of his brother, but retain’d his name--might bear him company in the quest of him:                        130whom whilst i labour’d of a love to see,i hazarded the loss of whom i loved.five summers have i spent in furthest greece,roaming clean through the bounds of asia,and, coasting homeward, came to ephesus;                           135hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsoughtor that, or any place that harbours men.but here must end the story of my life;and happy were i in my timely death,could all my travels warrant me they live.                         140_duke._ hapless ægeon, whom the fates have mark’dto bear the extremity of dire mishap!now, trust me, were it not against our laws,against my crown, my oath, my dignity,which princes, would they, may not disannul,                       145my soul should sue as advocate for thee.but, though thou art adjudged to the death,and passed sentence may not be recall’dbut to our honour’s great disparagement,yet will i favour thee in what i can.                              150therefore, merchant, i’ll limit thee this dayto seek thy help by beneficial help:try all the friends thou hast in ephesus;beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,and live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.                      155gaoler, take him to thy custody._gaol._ i

but three or fiveseems too small an age to assign for the commencement of this patronage.antipholus saved the duke’s life in the wars ‘long since,’ v.\\xa01. 161,191. his ‘long experience’ of his wife’s ‘wisdom’ and her ‘years’ arementioned, iii. 1. 89, 90. but shakespeare probably did not compute theresult of his own figures with any great care or accuracy.       *       *       *       *       *           *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       *sources:the editors’ preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and18th-century editions in detail;

boston public libraryprefacethe text of this edition of _julius cæsar_ is based upon a collation ofthe seventeenth century folios, the globe edition, and that of delius.as compared with the text of the earlier editions of hudson\\'sshakespeare, it is conservative. exclusive of changes in spelling,punctuation, and stage directions, very few emendations by eighteenthcentury and nineteenth century editors have been adopted; and these,with every variation from the first folio, are indicated in the textualnotes. these notes are printed immediately below the text so that areader or student may see at a glance the evidence in the case of adisputed reading and have some definite understanding of the reasons forthose differences in the text of shakespeare which frequently surpriseand very often annoy. a consideration of the more poetical, or the moredramatically effective, of two variant readings will often lead to richresults in awakening a spirit of discriminating interpretation and indeveloping true creative criticism. in no sense is this a textualvariorum edition. the variants given are only those of importance andhigh authority.the spelling and the punctuation of the text are modern, except in thecase of verb terminations in _-ed_, which, when the _e_ is silent, areprinted with the apostrophe in its place. this is the general usage inthe first folio. modern spelling has to a certain extent been followedin the text variants; but the original spelling has been retainedwherever its peculiarities have been the basis for important textualcriticism and emendation.with the exception of the position of the textual variants, the plan ofthis edition is similar to that of the old hudson shakespeare. it isimpossible to specify the various instances of revision andrearrangement in the matter of the introduction and the interpretativenotes, but the endeavor has been to retain all that gave the old editionits unique place and to add the results of what seems vital andpermanent in later inquiry and research.while it is important that the principle of _suum cuique_ be attended toso far as is possible in matters of research and scholarship, it isbecoming more and more difficult to give every man his own inshakespearian annotation. the amount of material accumulated is so greatthat the identity-origin of much important comment and suggestion iseither wholly lost or so crushed out of shape as to be beyondrecognition. instructive significance perhaps attaches to this inediting the works of one who quietly made so much of materials gatheredby others. but the list of authorities given on page li will indicatethe chief source of much that has gone to enrich the value of thisedition. professor w. p. trent, of columbia university, has offeredvaluable suggestions and given important advice; and to mr. m. grantdaniell\\'s patience, accuracy, and judgment this volume owes both itsfreedom from many a blunder and its possession of a carefully

of thisplay, where the reference is to this edition.i. sourcesno event in the history of the world has made a more profound impressionupon the popular imagination than the assassination of julius cæsar.apart from its overwhelming interest as a personal catastrophe, it wasregarded in the sixteenth century as a happening of the greatesthistorical moment, fraught with significant public lessons for all time.there is ample evidence that in england from the beginning ofelizabeth\\'s reign it was the subject of much literary and dramatictreatment, and in making the murder of \"the mightiest julius\" the climaxof a play, shakespeare was true to that instinct which drew him formaterial to themes of universal and eternal interest.the main storyi. _north\\'s plutarch._ there is no possible doubt that in _julius cæsar_shakespeare derived the great body of his historical material from _thelife of julius cæsar_, _the life of marcus brutus_, and _the life ofmarcus antonius_ in sir thomas north\\'s translation of plutarch.[1] thiswork was first printed in 1579 in a massive folio dedicated to queenelizabeth. a second edition appeared in 1595, and in all probabilitythis was the edition read by shakespeare. the title-page is reproducedin facsimile on page ix. this interesting title-page gives in brief theliterary history of north\\'s translation, which was made not directlyfrom the original greek of plutarch, but from a french version byjacques amyot, bishop of auxerre.[2] in 1603 appeared a third editionwith additional _lives_ and new matter on the title-page.[3] there weresubsequent editions in 1612,[4] 1631, 1656, and 1676. the popularity ofthis work attested by these reprintings was thoroughly deserved, fornorth\\'s plutarch is among the richest and freshest monuments ofelizabethan prose literature, and, apart altogether from the use made ofit by shakespeare, is in itself an invaluable repertory of honest,manly, idiomatic english. no abstract of the plutarchian matter need begiven here, as all the more important passages drawn upon for the playare quoted in the footnotes to the text. these will show that in most ofthe leading incidents the great greek biographer is closely followed,though in many cases these incidents are worked out and developed withrare fertility of invention and art. it is very significant that in thesecond half of _the life of julius cæsar_, which shakespeare draws uponvery heavily, plutarch emphasizes those weaknesses of cæsar which aremade so prominent in the play. besides this, in many places theplutarchian form and order of thought, and also the very words ofnorth\\'s racy and delectable english are retained, with such an embalmingfor immortality as shakespeare alone could give.[5][footnote 1: professor w. w. skeat\\'s _shakespeare\\'s plutarch_ (themacmillan company) gives these _lives_ in convenient form with a textbased upon the edition of 1612.][footnote 2: a latin translation of plutarch\\'s _lives_ was printed atrome as early as 1470, and there is evidence that through a latinversion the work first attracted the attention of amyot. but his famousfrench version, first published in 1559, shows thorough familiarity withthe original greek text.][footnote 3: this title-page is given in facsimile as the frontispieceof this volume.][footnote 4: there is a famous copy of this edition in the

(2) minorincidents and happenings, as cæsar\\'s falling-sickness, the omens beforehis death, and the writings thrown in brutus\\'s way; (3) touches ofdetail, as in the description of cassius\\'s \"lean and hungry look\" and ofantony\\'s tastes and personal habits; and (4) noteworthy expressions,phrases, and single words, as in iii, ii, 240-241, 246-248; iv, iii, 2;iv, iii, 178; v, i, 80-81; v, iii, 109.on the other hand, shakespeare\\'s alteration of plutarchian material isalong the lines of (1) idealization, as in the characters of brutus andcassius; (2) amplification, as in the use antony makes of cæsar\\'s rentand bloody mantle; and (3) simplification and compression of the actionfor dramatic effect, as in making cæsar\\'s triumph take place at thetime of \"the feast of lupercal,\" in the treatment of the quarrel betweenbrutus and cassius, which in plutarch lasts for two days, and in makingthe two battles of philippi occur on the same day. see note, p. 159,

from plutarch given in the note, p. 68, l.33, this account of the same incident in appian: \"the day before thatcæsar should go to the senate, he had him at a banquet with lepidus ...and talking merrily what death was best for a man, some saying one andsome another, he of all praised sudden death.\" here are some of themarginal summaries in appian: \"cæsar refuseth the name of king,\" \"acrown upon cæsar\\'s image by one that was apprehended of the tribunesmarullus and sitius,\" \"cæsar hath the falling-sickness,\" \"cæsar\\'s wife(hath) a fearful dream,\" \"cæsar contemneth sacrifices of evil luck,\"\"cæsar giveth over when brutus had stricken him,\" \"the fear of theconspirators,\" \"the bad angel of brutus.\"what gives interest and distinction to appian\\'s translation as aprobable source for material in _julius cæsar_ is that in it we havespeeches by antony, brutus, and lepidus at the time of the reading ofcæsar\\'s will. in this translation antony\\'s first speech begins, \"theythat would have voices tried upon cæsar must know afore that if heruled as an officer lawfully chosen, then all his acts and decrees muststand in force....\" on antony\\'s second speech the comment is, \"thuswrought antony artificially.\" his speech to the senate begins, \"silencebeing commanded, he said thus, \\'of the citizens offenders (you men ofequal honour) in this your consultation i have said nothing....\\'\" thespeech of lepidus to the people has this setting: \"when he was come tothe place of speech he lamented, weeping, and thus said, \\'here i wasyesterday with cæsar, and now am i here to inquire of cæsar\\'s death....cæsar is gone from us, an holy and honourable man in deed.\\'\" the effectof this speech is commented on as follows: \"handling the matter thuscraftily, the hired men, knowing that he was ambitious, praised him andexhorted him to take the office of cæsar\\'s priesthood.\" a long speech bybrutus follows the reading of cæsar\\'s will. it begins: \"now, o citizens,we be here with you that yesterday were in the common court not as menfleeing to the temple that have done amiss, nor as to a fort, havingcommitted all we have to you.... we have heard what hath been objectedagainst us of our enemies, touching the oath and touching cause ofdoubt....\" the effect of this speech is thus described: \"whiles brutusthus spake, all the hearers considering with themselves that he spakenothing but right, did like them well, and as men of courage and loversof the people, had them in great admiration and were turned into theirfavour.\"3. _earlier plays._ as already mentioned, england had plays on thesubject of julius cæsar from the first years of elizabeth\\'s reign. asnot one of these earlier plays is extant, there can be no certainty asto whether shakespeare drew upon them for materials or inspiration, but,as professor herford says, \"he seems to be cognisant of theirexistence.\" his opening scene is addressed to a public familiar with thehistory of pompey and pompey\\'s sons. among these earlier plays was onealmost contemporary with the first production of _gorboduc_, the firstenglish tragedy. it is referred to under the name of _julyus sesar_ inan entry in machyn\\'s _diary_ under february 1, 1562. in _plays confutedin five actions_, printed probably in 1582, stephen gosson mentions thehistory of _cæsar and pompey_ as a contemporary play. a latin play oncæsar\\'s death was acted at oxford in 1582, and for it dr. richard eedes(eades, edes) of christ church wrote the epilogue (_epilogus cæsarisintersecti_). in henslowe\\'s _diary_ under november 8, 1594, a _seser andpompie_ is mentioned as a new play. mr. a. w. verity (_julius cæsar_,the pitt press edition) makes the interesting suggestion that in iii, i,111-116, there may be an allusion to these earlier plays. cf. also_hamlet_, iii, ii, 107-111, quoted below.the scene of the assassinationin transferring the assassination of cæsar from the _porticus pompeia_(\"pompey\\'s porch,\" i, iii, 126) to the capitol, shakespeare departedfrom plutarch and historical accuracy to follow a popular tradition thathad received the signal imprimatur of chaucer:  this iulius to the capitolie wente  upon a day, as he was wont to goon,[1]  and in the capitolie anon him hente[2]  this false brutus, and his othere foon[3]  and stikede him with boydekins[4] anoon  with many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye;  but never gronte[5] he at no strook but oon,  or elles at two, but if[6] his storie lye.        _the monkes tale_, ll. 715-718. (skeat\\'s _chaucer_.)[footnote 1: go.][footnote 2: seized.][footnote 3: foes.][footnote 4: daggers.][footnote 5: groaned.][footnote 6: unless.]this literary and popular tradition is followed in _hamlet_, iii, ii,107-111:  hamlet. what did you enact?  polonius. i did enact julius cæsar: i was kill\\'d i\\' the capitol:  brutus kill\\'d me.  hamlet. it was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.so also in _antony and cleopatra:_                    since julius cæsar,  who at philippi the good brutus ghosted,  there saw you labouring for him. what was \\'t  that mov\\'d pale cassius to conspire; and what  made the all-honour\\'d, honest roman, brutus,  with the arm\\'d rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,  to drench the capitol; but that they would  have one man but a man?      [ii, vi, 12-19.]we have the same popular tradition in the first scene of the last act offletcher\\'s _the noble gentleman_. so, too, in the prologue to beaumontand fletcher\\'s, or fletcher and massinger\\'s, _the false one_, a tragedydealing with cæsar and cleopatra:                          to tell  of cæsar\\'s amorous heats, and how he fell  i\\' the capitol.here the reference is to shakespeare\\'s play.\"et tu, brute\"dyce and other researchers have made clear that in shakespeare\\'s day\"_et tu, brute_\" was a familiar phrase which had special reference to awound from a supposed friend. it probably owed its popularity to havingbeen used in the earlier plays on the subject of julius cæsar. in _thetrue tragedie of richard duke of york_ (1595), upon which shakespeare\\'s_3 henry vi_ is based, occurs the line,  _et tu, brute?_ wilt thou stab cæsar too?this line is repeated in s. nicholson\\'s poem, _acolastus, hisafterwitte_ (1600). in ben jonson\\'s _every man out of his humour_(1599), buffone uses \"_et tu, brute_\" in speaking to macilente (v, iv).in the _myrroure for magistrates_ (1587) we find,  and brutus thou, my sonne, quoth i, whom erst i loved best.the latin form of the phrase possibly originated, as malone suggested,in the latin play referred to above (earlier plays) which was acted atoxford in 1582. it is easy to see how the elizabethan tendency toword-quibble and equivoque would help to give currency to the latinform. cf. hamlet\\'s joke on \\'brute\\' quoted above.brutus\\'s speech, iii, iiin view of the close connection between _julius cæsar_ and _hamlet_ asregards date of composition and the characterization of brutus andhamlet, interest attaches to professor gollancz\\'s theory (_juliuscæsar_, temple shakespeare) that the original of the famous speech ofbrutus to the assembled romans (iii, ii) may be found in belleforest\\'s_history of hamlet_, in the oration which hamlet makes to the danesafter he has slain his uncle. \"the situation of hamlet is almostidentical with that of brutus after he has dealt the blow, and theburden of hamlet\\'s too lengthy speech finds an echo in brutus\\'ssententious utterance. the verbose iteration of the dane has beencompressed to suit \\'the brief compendious manner of speech of thelacedæmonians.\\'\"--gollancz. as the english translation from whichprofessor gollancz quotes in support of his theory is dated 1608, and isthe earliest known,[1] it cannot have been from this that shakespearedrew any suggestions or material. the question arises, did shakespeareread the speech in the original french? the volume of belleforest\\'s_histoires tragiques_, which contained the story of hamlet, was firstpublished in 1570, and there were many reprintings of it before 1600.[footnote 1: reprinted in collier\\'s _shakespeare\\'s library_. thistranslation shows in more than one place the influence of shakespeare\\'splay. for example, hamlet\\'s exclamation before he kills polonius, \"arat! a rat!\" is in the english version, but there is no suggestion of itin the french original.]ii. date of compositionmodern editors fix the date of composition of _julius cæsar_ within1601, the later time limit (_terminus ante quem_), and 1598, the earliertime limit (_terminus post quem_). the weight of evidence is in favor of1600-1601.external evidence1. _negative._ _julius cæsar_ is not mentioned by meres in the _palladistamia_, published in 1598, which gives a list of twelve noteworthyshakespeare plays in existence at that time. this establishes 1598 as aprobable _terminus post quem_.2. _positive._ in john weever\\'s _mirror of martyrs or the life and deathof sir john oldcastle knight, lord cobham_, printed in 1601, are thefollowing lines:  the many-headed multitude were drawne  by _brutus_ speech that _cæsar_ was ambitious,  when eloquent _mark antonie_ had showne  his vertues, who but _brutus_ then was vicious?      man\\'s memorie, with new, forgets the old,      one tale is good, until another\\'s told.halliwell-phillipps was the first to note that here is a very pointedreference to the second scene of the third act of _julius cæsar_, as theantithesis brought out is not indicated in any of shakespeare\\'shistorical sources. the fact that weever states in his dedication thatthe _mirror_ \"some two years agoe was made fit for the print\" has beenheld by mr. percy simpson[1] to indicate that the play was not broughtout later than 1599, a conclusion supported, he thinks, by a passage inben jonson\\'s _every man out of his humour_, produced in that year, whereclove (iii, i) says, \"then coming to the pretty animal, as _reason longsince is fled to animals_, you know,\" which may be a sneering allusionto antony\\'s \"o judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts\" (iii, ii,104). the \"_et tu, brute_\" quotation in the same play has been used tostrengthen the argument. but the lines from the _mirror of martyrs_quoted above may easily have been inserted by weever into his poem inconsequence of the popularity of shakespeare\\'s play. this contemporarypopularity is well attested. leonard digges,[2] in his verses _uponmaster william shakespeare_ prefixed to the 1640 edition ofshakespeare\\'s poems, thus compares it with that of ben jonson\\'s romanplays:  so have i seene, when cesar would appeare,  and on the stage at halfe-sword parley were  _brutus_ and _cassius_: oh how the audience  were ravish\\'d, with what new wonder they went thence,  when some new day they would not brooke a line  of tedious (though well laboured) _catiline_;  _sejanus_ too was irkesome, they priz\\'de more  honest _iago_, or the jealous _moore_.[footnote 1: in _notes and queries_, february, 1899.][footnote 2: leonard digges also wrote verses \"to the memorie of thedeceased authour maister w. shakespeare,\" prefixed to the first folio.]\"fustian\" clove\\'s quotation may apply to references to the pythagoreandoctrine of the transmigration of souls in shakespeare\\'s earlier playsand other elizabethan literature; and little can be based upon the \"_ettu, brute_\" quotation, as ben jonson may have drawn it from the samesource as shakespeare did.on the other hand, henslowe in his _diary_ under may 22, 1602, notesthat he advanced five pounds \"in earneste of a boocke called _sesersfalle_,\" which the dramatists munday, drayton, webster, middleton \"andthe rest\" were composing for lord nottingham\\'s company. _cæsar\\'s fall_was plainly intended to outshine shakespeare\\'s popular play, but, asprofessor herford comments, \"the lost play ... for the rival companywould have been a somewhat tardy counterblast to an old piece of 1599.\"he adds: \"_julius cæsar_ was certainly not unconcerned in the revival ofthe fashion for tragedies of revenge with a ghost in them, whichsuddenly set in with marston\\'s _antonio and mellida_ and chettle\\'s_hoffman_ in 1601.\"dr. furnivall, a strong advocate for 1601 as the date of composition,has suggested[1] that essex\\'s ill-judged rebellion against queenelizabeth, on sunday, february 8, 1601, was the reason of shakespeare\\'sproducing his _julius cæsar_ in that year. \"assuredly,\" he says, \"thecitizens of london in that year who heard shakespeare\\'s play must havefelt the force of \\'_et tu, brute_,\\' and must have seen brutus\\'s death,with keener and more home-felt influence than we feel and hear thethings with now.\"drayton\\'s revised version of his _mortimeriados_ (1596-1597); publishedin 1603 under the title of _the barons\\' wars_, has a passage whichstrongly resembles some lines in antony\\'s last speech (v, v, 73-74), butcommon property in the idea that a well-balanced mixture of the fourelements (earth, air, fire, and water) produces a perfect maninvalidates any argument for the date of the play based upon thisevidence. see note, p. 167, l. 73.internal evidencedr. w. a. wright[2] has argued against an earlier date than 1600 for thecomposition of _julius caesar_ from the use of \\'eternal\\' for \\'infernal\\'in i, ii, 160. see note, p. 20, l. 160. of course there is no certaintythat shakespeare wished to use the word \\'infernal,\\' and, besides, ifany substitution was made, it may have been at a later date. butadumbrations of _hamlet_ everywhere in _julius cæsar_, the frequentreferences to cæsar in _hamlet_, the kinship in character of brutus andhamlet (see note, p. 46, l. 65), the treatment of the supernatural, andthe development of the revenge motive give strong cumulative evidencethat the composition of _julius cæsar_ is in time very near to that of_hamlet_, the first shakespearian draft of which is now generallyconceded to date from the first months of 1602. the diction of _juliuscæsar_, the quality of the blank verse, the style generally (see below,versification and diction), all point to 1601 as the probable date ofcomposition. it has been said that a true taste for shakespeare is likethe creation of a special sense; and this saying is nowhere betterapproved than in reference to his subtile variations of language andstyle. he began with what may be described as a preponderance of thepoetic element over the dramatic. as we trace his course onward, we maydiscover a gradual rising of the latter element into greater strengthand prominence, until at last it had the former in complete subjection.now, where positive external evidence is wanting, it is mainly from therelative strength of these elements that the probable date of thewriting may be argued. in _julius cæsar_ the diction is more gliding andcontinuous, and the imagery more round and amplified, than in theearlier dramas or in those known to belong to shakespeare\\'s latestperiod.[footnote 1: in _the academy_, september 18, 1875. see also _the leopoldshakspere_, introduction.][footnote 2: _julius cæsar_, the clarendon press, introduction, p.viii.]these distinctive notes are of a nature more easily to be felt thandescribed, and to make them felt examples will best serve. take then apassage from the soliloquy of brutus just after he has pledged himselfto the conspiracy:                     \\'tis a common proof,  that lowliness is young ambition\\'s ladder,  whereto the climber upward turns his face;  but when he once attains the upmost round,  he then unto the ladder turns his back,  looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees  by which he did ascend. [ii, i, 21-27.]here we have a full, rounded period in which all the elements seem tohave been adjusted, and the whole expression set in order, before anypart of it was written down. the beginning foresees the end, the endremembers the beginning, and the thought and image are evolved togetherin an even, continuous flow. the thing is indeed perfect in its way,still it is not in shakespeare\\'s latest and highest style. now take apassage from _the winter\\'s tale_:                    when you speak, sweet,  i\\'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,  i\\'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,  pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,  to sing them too: when you do dance, i wish you  a wave o\\' the sea, that you might ever do  nothing but that; move still, still so,  and own no other function. [iv, iv, 136-143.]here the workmanship seems to make and shape itself as it goes along,thought kindling thought, and image prompting image, and each partneither concerning itself with what has gone before, nor with what iscoming after. the very sweetness has a certain piercing quality, and wetaste it from clause to clause, almost from word to word, as so manykeen darts of poetic rapture shot forth in rapid succession. yet thepassage, notwithstanding its swift changes of imagery and motion, isperfect in unity and continuity.iii. early editionsfolioson november 8, 1623, edward blount and isaac jaggard obtained formallicense to print \"mr. william shakespeere\\'s comedyes, histories, andtragedyes, soe many of the said copies as are not formerly entered toother men.\" this is the description-entry in _the stationers\\' registers_of what is now known as the first folio (1623), designated in thetextual notes of this edition f1. _julius cæsar_ is one of the plays\"not formerly entered,\"[1] and it was first printed, so far as is known,in this famous volume. it is more correctly printed than perhaps anyother play in the first folio and, as the editors of the cambridgeshakespeare suggest, \"may perhaps have been (as the preface falselyimplied that all were[2]) printed from the original manuscript of theauthor.\"[3] it stands between _timon of athens_ and _macbeth_, two verybadly printed plays. the running title is _the tragedie of juliuscæsar_, but in the \"catalogve of the seuerall comedies, histories, andtragedies contained in this volume,\" the title is given as _the life anddeath of julius cæsar_.[footnote 1: this is strong evidence that the play had not been printedat an earlier date.][footnote 2: \"... absolute in their numbers, as he conceiued them....his mind and hand went together: and what he thought, he vttered withthat easinesse, that wee haue scarse receiued from him a blot in hispapers\" (heminge and condell\\'s address \"to the great variety ofreaders,\" first folio).][footnote 3: mr. f. g. fleay in his shakespeare manual (1876) argues that\"this play as we have it is an abridgement of shakespeare\\'s play made byben jonson.\"]the second folio, f2 (1632), the third folio, f3 (1663, 1664), and thefourth folio, f4 (1685), show few variants in the text of _julius cæsar_and none of importance.the quarto of 1691in 1691 _julius cæsar_ appeared in quarto form. this quarto containedone famous text variant, \\'hath\\' for \\'path\\' in ii, i, 83. though thefolio text here offers difficulties, and modern editors have suggestedmany emendations, no one has been inclined to accept the commonplacereading of the quarto.rowe\\'s editionsin the folios and in the quarto of 1691 the play is divided into acts,but not into scenes, though the first act is headed _actus primus, scænaprima_. the first systematic division into scenes was made by nicholasrowe, poet laureate to george i, in the edition which he issued in sixoctavo volumes in 1709. in this edition rowe, an experienced playwright,marked the entrances and exits of the characters and introduced manystage directions and the list of dramatis personæ which has been thebasis for all later lists. a second edition in eight volumes waspublished in 1714. rowe followed very closely the text of the fourthfolio, but modernized spelling, punctuation, and occasionally grammar.these are the first critical editions of shakespeare\\'s plays.iv. the titleit has been justly observed that shakespeare shows much judgment in thenaming of his plays. from this observation several critics have excepted_julius cæsar_, pronouncing the title a misnomer, on the ground thatbrutus, and not cæsar, is the hero of it. it is indeed true that brutusis the hero, but the play is rightly named, for cæsar is not only thesubject but also the governing power of it throughout. he is the centerand springhead of the entire action, giving law and shape to everythingthat is said and done. this is manifestly true in what occurs before hisdeath; and it is true in a still deeper sense afterwards, since hisgenius then becomes the nemesis or retributive providence.v. dramatic construction and development_julius cæsar_ is a tragedy of a normal shakespearian type, in which isrepresented a conflict between an individual, or group of individuals,and certain forces which environ, antagonize, and overwhelm. the unityof action and of interest is the personality of julius cæsar. indramatic technique the play is simple and effective. out of masses ofdetail and historical incident the dramatist has shaped a symmetricaland well-defined plot marked by (1) the exposition, or introduction, (2)the complication, or rising action, (3) the climax, or turning point,(4) the resolution, or falling action, and (5) the catastrophe, orconclusion. it is almost a commonplace of criticism that the openingscene of a shakespeare play strikes the keynote of the action. itcertainly does in a remarkable way in _julius cæsar_, introducing, onthe one side, a group of excited citizens friendly to cæsar, and, on theother, two tribunes hostile to him. it foreshadows thecharacter-contrasts in the play and the conflict between the state andthe individual. the exposition continues through the second scene, inwhich are introduced the leading characters in significant action andinteraction. at the close of this scene cassius lays his plans to winbrutus over to the conspiracy, and the complication, or rising action,of the drama begins. through the last scene of the first act and thefour scenes of the second act the growth of the complication iscontinued, with brief intervals of suspense, until, in the first sceneof the third act, the climax is reached in the assassination of cæsarand the wild enthusiasm of the conspirators. with the entry of antony\\'sservant begins the resolution, or falling action (see note, p. 89, l.123), and from now, through intervals of long suspense and manyvicissitudes,[1] the fortunes of the chief conspirators fall inevitablyto the catastrophe.analysis by act and scene[2][footnote 1: for an interesting defense of the so-called \\'dragging\\'tendency and episodical character of the third scene of the fourth act,see professor a. c. bradley\\'s _shakespearean tragedy_, pp. 55-61.][footnote 2: \"it must be understood that a play can be analyzed intovery different schemes of plot. it must not be thought that one of theseschemes is right and the rest wrong;

and the pathos is not terrible or lacerating, but,even if painful, is accompanied by the sense of beauty and by an outflowof admiration or affection, which come with an inexpressible sweetnessafter the tension of the crisis and the first counter-stroke. so it iswith the reconciliation of brutus and cassius, and the arrival of thenews of portia\\'s death.\"--bradley. while the shadow of her tragicpassing overhangs the spirits of both, brutus overhears the shrewd,cautious counsel of cassius and persuades him to assent to the fatalpolicy of offering battle at philippi. that night the ghost of cæsarappears to brutus._act v, scene i._ the action now falls rapidly to the quick, decisivemovement of the dénouement. the antagonists are now face to face. brutusand cassius have done what antony and octavius hoped that they would do.the opposing generals hold a brief parley in which brutus intimates thathe is willing to effect a reconciliation, but antony rejects hisproposals and bluntly charges him and cassius with the wilful murder ofcæsar. cassius reminds brutus of his warning that antony should havefallen when cæsar did. antony, octavius, and their army retire, and thescene closes with the noble farewell without hope between brutus andcassius._act v, scene ii._ the opposing armies meet on the field, and a finalflare-up of hope in the breast of brutus is indicated by his spiritedorder to messala to charge. the scene implies that cassius was defeatedby being left without support by brutus.v. dénouement, catastrophe, or conclusion (the knot untied)_act v, scene iii._ the charge ordered by brutus has been successful,and octavius has been driven back, but cassius is thus left unguarded,and antony\\'s forces surround him. he takes refuge on a hill and sendstitinius to see \"whether yond troops are friend or enemy.\" believingtitinius to be slain, he begs pindarus to stab him, and cassius dies\"even with the sword that kill\\'d\" cæsar. with the same sword titiniusthen slays himself, and brutus, when messala bears the news to him,exclaims in words that strike the keynote of the whole falling actionand dénouement:  o julius cæsar, thou art mighty yet!  thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords  in our own proper entrails._act v, scene iv._ like hamlet, brutus at the last is a man of supremeaction. he rallies his forces for a last attack. with hopeless failurebefore him, he is at once a heroic figure and one of infinite pathos.young cato falls. lucilius is attacked;

in iii, ii, 261,antony is told by his servant immediately after the funeral oration that\"octavius is already come to rome.\" in november, b.c. 43, the triumvirsmet to make up their bloody proscription, and in the autumn of thefollowing year were fought the two battles of philippi, separatedhistorically by twenty days, but represented by shakespeare as takingplace on the same day.2. _dramatic time._ historical happenings that extended over nearlythree years are represented in the stage action as the occurrences ofsix days, distributed over the acts and scenes as follows:  day 1.--i, i, ii.      interval.  day 2.--i, iii.  day 3.--ii, iii.      interval.  day 4.--iv, i.      interval.  day 5.--iv, ii, iii.      interval.  day 6.--v.this compression for the purposes of dramatic unity results in actionthat is swift and throbbing with human and ethical interest.3. _place._ up to the second scene of the fourth act rome is the naturalplace of action. the second and third scenes of the fourth act are atsardis in asia minor; the last act shifts to philippi in macedonia. theonly noteworthy deviation from historical accuracy is in making theconference of the triumvirs take place at rome and not at bononia. seenote, p. 116. but there is peculiar dramatic effectiveness in placingthis fateful colloquy in the city that was the center of the politicalunrest of the time.vii. versification and dictionblank versethe characteristics of shakespeare\\'s blank verse--the rhymeless, iambicfive-stress (decasyllabic) verse, or iambic pentameter, introduced intoengland by henry howard, earl of surrey, about 1540--and its proportionto rhyme and to prose have been much used in recent years to determinethe chronological order of the plays and the development of the poet\\'sart. in blank verse as used by shakespeare we have really an epitome ofthe development of the measure in connection with the english drama. inhis earlier plays the blank verse is often similar to that of_gorboduc_, the first english tragedy. the tendency is to adhere to thesyllable-counting principle, to make the line the unit, the sentence andphrase coinciding with the line (end-stopped verse), and to use fiveperfect iambic feet to the line. in plays of the middle period, such as_the merchant of venice_ and _as you like it_, written between 1596 and1600, the blank verse is more like that of kyd and marlowe, with lessmonotonous regularity in the structure and an increasing tendency tocarry on the sense from one line to another without a syntactical orrhetorical pause at the end of the line (run-on verse, _enjambement_).redundant syllables now abound and the melody is richer and fuller. inshakespeare\\'s later plays the blank verse breaks away from all bondageto formal line limits, and the organic continuity is found in asuccession of great metrical periods.the verse of _julius cæsar_ is less monotonously regular than that ofthe earlier plays; it is more flexible and varied, more musical andsonorous, but it lacks the superb movement of the verse in _othello_,_the winter\\'s tale_, and _the tempest_. end-stopped, normally regulariambic pentameter lines often occur (as, for instance, i, i, 37, 41, 44,62, 76), but everywhere are variations and deviations from the norm, andthere is an unusual number of short lines and interjectional lines oftwo or three stresses. see abbott\\'s _a shakespearian grammar_, §§ 511,512.rhymeapart from the use of rhyme in songs, lyrics, and portions of masques(as in _the tempest_, iv, i, 60-138), a progress from more to less rhymeis a sure index to shakespeare\\'s development as a dramatist and a masterof expression. in the early _love\\'s labour\\'s lost_ are more than onethousand rhyming five-stress iambic lines; in _the tempest_ are onlytwo; in _the winter\\'s tale_ not one. _in julius cæsar_ are found onlythirty-four rhyming lines.proseif \"of the soule the bodie forme doth take,\" it is small wonder thatattempts have been made to explain shakespeare\\'s distinctive use ofverse and prose. of recent years there have been interesting discussionsof the question \"whether we are justified in supposing that shakespearewas guided by any fixed principle in his employment of verse and prose,or whether he merely employed them, as fancy suggested, for the sake ofvariety and relief.\"[1] it is a significant fact that in many ofshakespeare\\'s earlier plays there is little or no prose, and that theproportion of prose to blank verse increases with the decrease of rhyme.in _julius cæsar_ three kinds of prose may be distinguished: (1) theprose of homely dialogue, as in the talk of the common people in i, i,and iii, iii. (2) the prose of serious information as to the nature of asituation, as in casca\\'s description of the offer of the crown to cæsar.this kind of prose reaches its highest development in brutus\\'s famousspeech, iii, ii, with its dignified defense and laconic exposition ofhis honesty of purpose. (3) the prose of formal documents, as in theletter of artemidorus, ii, iii, 1-8.[footnote 1: professor j. churton collins\\'s _shakespeare as a prosewriter_. see delius\\'s _die prosa in shakespeares dramen (shakespearejahrbuch_, v, 227-273); janssen\\'s _die prosa in shakespeares dramen_;professor hiram corson\\'s _an introduction to the study of shakespeare_,pp. 83-98.]viii. the charactersjulius cæsarthe characterization of this drama in some of the parts is not a littleperplexing. hardly one of the speeches put into cæsar\\'s mouth can beregarded as historically characteristic; taken all together, they seemlittle short of a caricature. as here represented, cæsar appears littlebetter than a braggart; and when he speaks, it is in the style of aglorious vapourer, full of lofty airs and mock thunder. nothing couldbe further from the truth of the man, whose character, even in hisfaults, was as compact and solid as adamant, and at the same time aslimber and ductile as the finest gold. certain critics have seized andworked upon this, as proving shakespeare\\'s lack of classical knowledge,or carelessness in the use of his authorities. it proves neither the onenor the other.it is true, cæsar\\'s ambition was gigantic, but none too much so for themind it dwelt in; for his character in all its features was gigantic.and no man ever framed his ambition more in sympathy with the greatforces of nature, or built it upon a deeper foundation of politicalwisdom and insight. now this \"last infirmity of noble minds\" is the onlypart of him that the play really sets before us; and even this we do notsee as it was, because it is here severed from the constitutionalpeerage of his gifts and virtues; all those transcendent qualities whichplaced him at the summit of roman intellect and manhood being eitherwithheld from the scene or thrown so far into the background that theproper effect of them is lost.yet we have ample proof that shakespeare understood cæsar thoroughly,and that he regarded him as \"the noblest man that ever lived in the tideof times.\" for example, in _hamlet_, he makes horatio, who is one of hiscalmest and most right-thinking characters, speak of him as \"themightiest julius.\" in _antony and cleopatra_, again, the heroine is madeto describe him as \"broad-fronted cæsar\"; and in _king richard thethird_ the young prince utters these lines:  that julius cæsar was a famous man:  with what his valour did enrich his wit,  his wit set down to make his valour live:  death makes no conquest of this conqueror. [iii, i, 84-87.]in fact, we need not go beyond shakespeare to gather that julius cæsar\\'swas the deepest, the most versatile, and the most multitudinous headthat ever figured in the political affairs of mankind.indeed, it is clear from this play itself that shakespeare did notproceed at all from ignorance or misconception of the man. for it isremarkable that, though cæsar delivers himself so out of character, yetothers, both foes and friends, deliver him much nearer the truth; sothat, while we see almost nothing of him directly, we nevertheless get,upon the whole, a just reflection of him. especially in the marvelousspeeches of antony and in the later events of the drama, both his inwardgreatness and his right of mastership over the roman world are fullyvindicated. for in the play as in the history, cæsar\\'s blood hastens andcements the empire which the conspirators thought to prevent. they soonfind that in the popular sympathies, and even in their own dumbremorses, he has \"left behind powers that will work for him.\" he proves,indeed, far mightier in death than in life; as if his spirit were becomeat once the guardian angel of his cause and an avenging angel to hisfoes.and so it was in fact. nothing did so much to set the people in lovewith royalty, both name and thing, as the reflection that their belovedcæsar, the greatest of their national heroes, the crown and consummationof roman genius and character, had been murdered for aspiring to it.thus their hereditary aversion to kingship was all subdued by theremembrance of how and why their cæsar fell; and they who, before, wouldhave plucked out his heart rather than he should wear a crown, would nowhave plucked out their own, to set a crown upon his head. such is thenatural result, when the intensities of admiration and compassion meettogether in the human breast.from all which it may well be thought that cæsar was too great for thehero of a drama, since his greatness, if brought forward in fullmeasure, would leave no room for anything else, at least would precludeany proper dramatic balance and equipoise. it was only as a sort ofunderlying potency, or a force withdrawn into the background, that hispresence was compatible with that harmony and reciprocity of severalcharacters which a well-ordered drama requires. at all events, it ispretty clear that, where he was, such figures as brutus and cassiuscould never be very considerable, save as his assassins. they would nothave been heard of in after times, if they had not \"struck the foremostman of all this world\"; in other words, the great sun of rome had to beshorn of his beams, else so ineffectual a fire as brutus could nowisecatch the eye.be this as it may, there is no doubt that shakespeare knew the wholeheight and compass of cæsar\\'s vast and varied capacity. it may beregretted that he did not render him as he evidently saw him, inasmuchas he alone, perhaps, of all the men who ever wrote could have given anadequate expression of that colossal man.it is possible that the policy of the drama may have been to representcæsar not as he was indeed, but as he must have appeared to theconspirators; to make us see him as they saw him, in order that they toomight have fair and equal judgment at our hands. for cæsar was literallytoo great to be seen by them, save as children often see bugbears bymoonlight, when their inexperienced eyes are mocked with air. andshakespeare may well have judged that the best way to set us righttowards them was by identifying us more or less with them in mentalposition, and making us share somewhat in their delusion. for there isscarce anything wherein we are so apt to err as in reference to thecharacters of men, when time has settled and cleared up the questions inwhich they lost their way: we blame them for not having seen as we see;while in truth the things that are so bathed in light to us were full ofdarkness to them, and we should have understood them better, had we beenin the dark along with them.cæsar, indeed, was not bewildered by the political questions of histime; but all the rest were, and therefore he seemed so to them; andwhile their own heads were swimming they naturally ascribed his seemingbewilderment to a dangerous intoxication. as for his marvelous career ofsuccess, they attributed this mainly to his good luck, such being thecommon refuge of inferior minds when they would escape the sense oftheir inferiority. hence, as generally happens with the highest order ofmen, his greatness had to wait the approval of later events. he indeed,far beyond any other man of his age, \"looked into the seeds of time\";but this was not, and could not be known, till time had developed thoseseeds into their fruits. why then may not shakespeare\\'s idea have beenso to order things that the full strength of the man should not appearin the play, as it did not in fact, till after his fall? this view willboth explain and justify the strange disguise--a sort of falsettogreatness--under which cæsar exhibits himself.now the seeming contradiction between cæsar as known and cæsar asrendered by shakespeare is what, more than anything else, perplexes.but a very refined, subtile, and peculiar irony pervades this, more thanany other of shakespeare\\'s plays; not intended as such, indeed, by thespeakers, but a sort of historic irony,--the irony of providence, so tospeak, or, if you please, of fate; much the same as is implied in theproverb, \"a haughty spirit goeth before a fall.\" this irony crops out inmany places. thus we have cæsar most blown with arrogance and godding itin the loftiest style when the daggers of the assassins are on the verypoint of leaping at him. so too, all along, we find brutus mostconfident in those very things where he is most at fault, or acting likea man \"most ignorant of what he\\'s most assured\"; as when he says that\"antony can do no more than cæsar\\'s arm when cæsar\\'s head is off.\" this,to be sure, is not meant ironically by him, but it is turned into ironyby the fact that antony soon tears the cause of the conspirators all topieces with his tongue. but, indeed, this sort of honest guile runs allthrough the piece as a perfusive and permeating efficacy. a still betterinstance of it occurs just after the murder, when the chiefs of theconspiracy are exulting in the transcendent virtue and beneficence oftheir deed, and in its future stage celebrity; and cassius says,--  so often shall the knot of us be call\\'d  the men that gave their country liberty. [iii, i, 118-119.]and again, a little later, when brutus says of antony, \"i know that weshall have him well to friend.\" not indeed that the men themselvesthought any irony in those speeches: it was natural, no doubt, that theyshould utter such things in all seriousness; but what they say isinterpreted into irony by the subsequent events. and when such ashallow idealist as brutus is made to overtop and outshine the greatestpractical genius the world ever saw, what is it but a refined andsubtile irony at work on a much larger scale, and diffusing itself,secretly, it may be, but not the less vitally, into the texture? it wasnot the frog that thought irony, when he tried to make himself as big asthe ox; but there was a pretty decided spice of irony in the mind thatconceived the fable.it is to be noted further that brutus uniformly speaks of cæsar withrespect, almost indeed with admiration. it is his ambition, not hisgreatness, that brutus resents; the thought that his own consequence isimpaired by cæsar\\'s elevation having no influence with him. withcassius, on the contrary, impatience of his superiority is the rulingmotive: he is all the while thinking of the disparagement he suffers bycæsar\\'s exaltation.                            this man  is now become a god, and cassius is  a wretched creature, and must bend his body  if cæsar carelessly but nod on him. [i, ii, 115-118.]  why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world  like a colossus, and we petty men  walk under his huge legs. [i, ii, 135-137.]thus he overflows with mocking comparisons, and finds his pastime inflouting at cæsar as having managed by a sham heroism to hoodwink theworld.and yet shakespeare makes cæsar characterize himself very much ascassius, in his splenetic temper, describes him. cæsar gods it in histalk, as if on purpose to approve the style in which cassius mockinglygods him. this, taken by itself, would look as if the dramatist sidedwith cassius; yet one can hardly help feeling that he sympathized ratherin antony\\'s great oration. and the sequel, as we have seen, justifiesantony\\'s opinion of cæsar. the subsequent course of things has theeffect of inverting the mockery of cassius against himself.the final issue of the conspiracy, as represented by shakespeare, is apretty conclusive argument of the blunder, not to say the crime, of itsauthors. cæsar, dead, tears them and their cause all to pieces. ineffect, they did but stab him into a mightier life; so that brutus mightwell say, as indeed he does at last,--  o julius cæsar, thou art mighty yet!  thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords  in our own proper entrails. [v, iii, 94-96.]the nemesis which asserts itself so sternly in the latter part of theplay may be regarded as a reflex of irony on some of the earlier scenes.this view infers the disguise of cæsar to be an instance of the profoundguile with which shakespeare sometimes plays upon his characters,humoring their bent, and then leaving them to the discipline of events.brutuscoleridge has a shrewd doubt as to what sort of a character shakespearemeant his brutus to be. for, in his thinking aloud just after thebreaking of the conspiracy to him, brutus avowedly grounds his purpose,not on anything cæsar has done, nor on what he is, but simply on what he_may become_ when crowned. he \"knows no personal cause to spurn at him\";nor has he \"known when his affections sway\\'d more than his reason\"; but\"he would be crown\\'d: how that might change his nature, there\\'s thequestion\"; and,                         since the quarrel  will bear no colour for the thing he is,  fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,  would run to these and these extremities;  and therefore think him as a serpent\\'s egg  which, hatch\\'d, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,  and kill him in the shell. [ii, i, 28-34.]so then brutus heads a plot to assassinate the man who, besides beingclothed with the sanctions of law as the highest representative of thestate, has been his personal friend and benefactor; all this, too, noton any ground of fact, but on an assumed probability that the crown willprove a sacrament of evil, and transform him into quite another man. astrange piece of casuistry indeed! but nowise unsuited to the spirit ofa man who was to commit the gravest of crimes, purely from a misplacedvirtue.and yet the character of brutus is full of beauty and sweetness. in allthe relations of life he is upright, gentle, and pure; of asensitiveness and delicacy of principle that cannot bosom the slighteststain; his mind enriched and fortified with the best extractions ofphilosophy; a man adorned with all the virtues which, in public andprivate, at home and in the circle of friends, win respect and charm theheart.being such a man, of course he could only do what he did under some sortof delusion. and so indeed it is. yet this very delusion serves,apparently, to ennoble and beautify him, as it takes him and works uponhim through his virtues. at heart he is a real patriot, every inch ofhim. but his patriotism, besides being somewhat hidebound withpatrician pride, is of the speculative kind, and dwells, where his wholecharacter has been chiefly formed, in a world of poetical andphilosophic ideals. he is an enthusiastic student of books. plato is hisfavorite teacher; and he has studiously framed his life and tuned histhoughts to the grand and pure conceptions won from that all but divinesource: plato\\'s genius walks with him in the senate, sits with him atthe fireside, goes with him to the wars, and still hovers about histent.his great fault, then, lies in supposing it his duty to be meddling withthings that he does not understand. conscious of high thoughts and justdesires, but with no gift of practical insight, he is ill fitted to\"grind among the iron facts of life.\" in truth, he does not really seewhere he is; the actual circumstances and tendencies amidst which helives are as a book written in a language he cannot read. the charactersof those who act with him are too far below the region of his principlesand habitual thinkings for him to take the true cast of them. himselfincapable of such motives as govern them, he just projects and suspendshis ideals in them, and then misreckons upon them as realizing the menof his own brain. so also he clings to the idea of the great and freerepublic of his fathers, the old rome that has ever stood to hisfeelings touched with the consecrations of time and glorified with thehigh virtues that have grown up under her cherishing. but, in the longreign of tearing faction and civil butchery, that which he worships hasbeen substantially changed, the reality lost. cæsar, already clothedwith the title and the power of imperator for life, would change theform so as to agree with the substance, the name so as to fit the thing.but brutus is so filled with the idea of that which has thus passedaway never to return that he thinks to save or recover the whole bypreventing such formal and nominal change.and so his whole course is that of one acting on his own ideas, not onthe facts that are before and around him. indeed, he does not _see_them; he merely dreams his own meaning into them. he is swift to do thatby which he thinks his country _ought to be benefited_. as the killingof cæsar stands in his purpose, he and his associates are to be\"sacrificers, not butchers.\" but that the deed may have the effect hehopes for, his countrymen generally must regard it in the same light ashe does. that they will do this is the very thing which he has _in fact_no reason to conclude; notwithstanding, because it is so _in his idea_,therefore he trusts that the conspirators will \"be called purgers, notmurderers.\" meanwhile, the plain truth is, that if his countrymen hadbeen capable of regarding the deed as a sacrifice, they would not havemade nor permitted any occasion for it. it is certain that, unless soconstrued, the act must prove fruitful of evil; all rome is full ofthings proving that it cannot be so construed; but this is what brutushas no eye to see.so too, in his oration \"to show the _reason_ of our cæsar\\'s death,\" hespeaks, in calm and dispassionate manner, just those things which hethinks ought to set the people right and himself right in their eyes,forgetting all the while that the deed cannot fail to make the peoplemad, and that popular madness is not a thing to be reasoned with. andfor the same cause he insists on sparing antony, and on permitting himto speak in cæsar\\'s funeral. to do otherwise would be unjust, and sowould overthrow the whole nature of the enterprise as it lives in hismind. and because in his idea it ought so to be, he trusts that antonywill make cæsar\\'s death the occasion of strengthening those who killedhim, not perceiving the strong likelihood, which soon passes into afact, that in cutting off cæsar they have taken away the only check onantony\\'s ambition. he ought to have foreseen that antony, instead ofbeing drawn to their side, would rather make love to cæsar\\'s place attheir expense.thus the course of brutus serves no end but to set on foot another civilwar, which naturally hastens and assures the very thing he sought toprevent. he confides in the goodness of his cause, not considering thatthe better the cause, the worse its chance with bad men. he thinks itsafe to trust others because he knows they can safely trust him; thesingleness of his own eye causing him to believe that others will see ashe sees, the purity of his own heart, that others will feel as he feels.here then we have a strong instance of a very good man doing a very badthing; and, withal, of a wise man acting most unwisely because hiswisdom knew not its place; a right noble, just, heroic spirit bearingdirectly athwart the virtues he worships. on the whole, it is notwonderful that brutus should have exclaimed, as he is said to have done,that he had worshiped virtue and found her at last but a shade. soworshiped, she may well prove a shade indeed! admiration of the man\\'scharacter, reprobation of his proceedings,--which of these is thestronger with us? and there is much the same irony in the representationof brutus as in that of cæsar; only the order of it is here reversed. asif one should say, \"o yes, yes! in the practical affairs of mankind yourcharming wisdom of the closet will doubtless put to shame the workingsof mere practical insight and sagacity.\"shakespeare\\'s exactness in the minutest details of character is wellshown in the speech already referred to; which is the utterance of a manphilosophizing most unphilosophically; as if the academy should betakeitself to the stump, and this too without any sense of the incongruity.plutarch has a short passage which served as a hint, not indeed for thematter, but for the style of that speech. \"they do note,\" says he, \"insome of his epistles that he counterfeited that brief compendious mannerof speech of the lacedæmonians. as, when the war was begun, he wroteunto the pergamenians in this sort: \\'i understand you have givendolabella money: if you have done it willingly, you confess you haveoffended me; if against your wills, show it then by giving mewillingly.\\'... these were brutus\\' manner of letters, which were honouredfor their briefness.\" the speech in question is far enough indeed frombeing a model of style either for oratory or anything else, but it isfinely characteristic; while its studied primness and epigrammaticfinish contrast most unfavorably with the frank-hearted yet artfuleloquence of antony.and what a rare significance attaches to the brief scene of brutus andhis drowsy boy lucius in camp a little before the catastrophe! there, inthe deep of the night, long after all the rest have lost themselves insleep, and when the anxieties of the issue are crowding upon him,--therewe have the earnest, thoughtful brutus hungering intensely for therepasts of treasured thought.  look, lucius, here\\'s the book i sought for so;  i put it in the pocket of my gown. [iv, iii, 252, 253.]what the man is, and where he ought to be, is all signified in these twolines. and do we not taste a dash of benignant irony in the impliedrepugnance between the spirit of the man and the stuff of his presentundertaking? the idea of a bookworm riding the whirlwind of war! thething is most like brutus; but how out of his element, how unspheredfrom his right place, it shows him! there is a touch of drollery in thecontrast, which the richest steeping of poetry does not disguise. andthe irony is all the more delectable for being so remote andunpronounced; like one of those choice arrangements in the background ofa painting, which, without attracting conscious notice, give a zest andrelish to what stands in front. the scene, whether for charm ofsentiment or felicity of conception, is one of the finest inshakespeare.brutus and cassiusthe characters of brutus and cassius are nicely discriminated, scarce aword falling from either but what smacks of the man. cassius is much thebetter conspirator, but much the worse man; and the better in thatbecause the worse in this. for brutus engages in the conspiracy ongrounds of abstract and ideal justice; while cassius holds it both awrong and a blunder to go about such a thing without making success hisfirst care. this, accordingly, is what he works for, being reckless ofall other considerations in his choice and use of means. withal he ismore impulsive and quick than brutus, because less under theself-discipline of moral principle. his motives, too, are of a much moremixed and various quality, because his habits of thinking and actinghave grown by the measures of experience; he studies to understand menas they are; brutus, as he thinks they ought to be. hence, in every casewhere brutus crosses him, brutus is wrong, and he is right,--right, thatis, if success be their aim. cassius judges, and surely rightly, thatthe end should give law to the means; and that \"the honorable men whosedaggers have stabb\\'d cæsar\" should not be hampered much withconscientious scruples.still brutus overawes him by his moral energy and elevation ofcharacter, and by the open-faced rectitude and purity of his principles.brutus has no thoughts or aims that he is afraid or ashamed to avow;cassius has many which he would fain hide even from himself. and hecatches a sort of inspiration and is raised above himself by contactwith brutus. and cassius, moreover, acts very much from personal hatredof cæsar, as remembering how, not long before, he and brutus had stoodfor the chief prætorship of the city, and brutus through cæsar\\'s favorhad got the election. and so shakespeare read in plutarch that \"cassius,being a choleric man, and hating cæsar privately more than he did thetyranny openly, incensed brutus against him.\" the effect of this isfinely worked out by the dramatist in the man\\'s affected scorn of cæsar,and in the scoffing humor in which he loves to speak of him. for such isthe natural language of a masked revenge.the tone of cassius is further indicated, and with exquisite art, in hissoliloquy where, after tempering brutus to his purpose, and finding howhis \"honorable metal may be wrought,\" he gently slurs him for beingpracticable to flatteries, and then proceeds to ruminate the scheme forworking upon his vanity, and thereby drawing him into the conspiracy;thus spilling the significant fact, that his own honor does not stickto practice the arts by which he thinks it is a shame to be seduced.it is a noteworthy point also that cassius is too practical and too muchof a politician to see any ghosts. acting on far lower principles thanhis leader, and such as that leader would spurn as both wicked and base,he therefore does no violence to his heart in screwing it to the work hetakes in hand; his heart is even more at home in the work than his head;whereas brutus, from the wrenching his heart has suffered, keepsreverting to the moral complexion of his first step. the remembrance ofthis is a thorn in his side; while cassius has no sensibilities ofnature for such compunctions to stick upon. brutus is never thoroughlyhimself after the assassination; that his heart is ill at ease is shownin a certain dogged tenacity of honor and overstraining of rectitude, asif he were struggling to make atonement with his conscience. the stab hegave cæsar planted in his own upright and gentle nature a germ ofremorse, which, gathering strength from every subsequent adversity, cameto embody itself in imaginary sights and sounds; the spirit of justice,made an ill angel to him by his own sense of wrong, hovering in thebackground of his after life, and haunting his solitary moments in theshape of cæsar\\'s ghost. and so it is well done, that he is made to seethe \"monstrous apparition\" just after his heart has been pierced throughwith many sorrows at hearing of portia\\'s shocking death.portiathe delineation of portia is completed in a few brief masterly strokes.once seen, the portrait ever after lives an old and dear acquaintance ofthe reader\\'s inner man. portia has strength enough to do and suffer forothers, but very little for herself. as the daughter of cato and thewife of brutus, she has set in her eye a pattern of how she ought tothink and act, being \"so father\\'d and so husbanded\"; but still her headfloats merged over the ears in her heart; and it is only when affectionspeaks that her spirit is hushed into the listening which she would fainyield only to the speech of reason. she has a clear idea of the stoicalcalmness and fortitude which appears so noble and so graceful in herbrutus; it all lies faithfully reproduced in her mind; she knows wellhow to honor and admire it; yet she cannot work it into the texture ofher character; she can talk it like a book, but she tries in vain tolive it.plutarch gives one most touching incident respecting her whichshakespeare did not use, though he transfused the sense of it into hiswork. it occurred some time after cæsar\\'s death, and when the civil warwas growing to a head: \"brutus, seeing the state of rome would beutterly overthrown, went ... unto the city of elea standing by the sea.there portia, being ready to depart from her husband brutus and toreturn to rome, did what she could to dissemble the grief and sorrow shefelt at her heart. but a certain painted table (picture) bewrayed her inthe end.... the device was taken out of the greek stories, howandromache accompanied her husband hector when he went out of the cityof troy to go to the wars, and how hector delivered her his little son,and how her eyes were never off him. portia, seeing this picture, andlikening herself to be in the same case, she fell a-weeping; and comingthither oftentimes in a day to see it, she wept still.\" the force ofthis incident is reproduced in the portia of the play; we have its fulleffect in the matter about her self-inflicted wound as compared with hersubsequent demeanor.portia gives herself that gash without flinching, and bears it without amurmur, as an exercise and proof of fortitude; and she translates herpains into smiles, all to comfort and support her husband. so long asthis purpose lends her strength, she is fully equal to her thought,because here her heart keeps touch perfectly with her head. but, thismotive gone, the weakness, if it be not rather the strength, of herwoman\\'s nature rushes full upon her; her feelings rise into anuncontrollable flutter, and run out at every joint and motion of herbody; and nothing can arrest the inward mutiny till affection againwhispers her into composure, lest she say something that may hurt orendanger her brutus.antonyshakespeare\\'s completed characterization of antony is in _antony andcleopatra_. in the later play antony is delineated with his nativeaptitudes for vice warmed into full development by the great egyptiansorceress. in _julius cæsar_ shakespeare emphasizes as one of antony\\'scharacteristic traits his unreserved adulation of cæsar, shown inreckless purveying to his dangerous weakness,--the desire to be called aking. already cæsar had more than kingly power, and it was the obviouspart of a friend to warn him against this ambition. here and there areapt indications of his proneness to those vicious levities and debasingluxuries which afterwards ripened into such a gigantic profligacy. hehas not yet attained to that rank and full-blown combination of cruelty,perfidy, and voluptuousness, which the world associates with his name,but he is plainly on the way to it. his profound and wilydissimulation, while knitting up the hollow truce with the assassins onthe very spot where \"great cæsar fell,\" is managed with admirable skill;his deep spasms of grief being worked out in just the right way toquench their suspicions, and make them run into the toils, when he callson them to render him their bloody hands. nor have they any right tocomplain, for he is but paying them in their own coin; and we think nonethe worse of him that he fairly outdoes them at their own practice.but antony\\'s worst parts as here delivered are his exultant treachery inproposing to use his colleague lepidus as at once the pack-horse and thescape-goat of the triumvirate, and his remorseless savagery in arrangingfor the slaughter of all that was most illustrious in rome, barteringaway his own uncle, to glut his revenge with the blood of cicero; thougheven here his revenge was less hideous than the cold-blooded policy ofyoung octavius. yet antony has in the play, as he had in fact, someright noble streaks in him; for his character was a very mixed one; andthere was to the last a fierce war of good and evil within him.especially he had an eye to see, a heart to feel, and a soul to honorthe superb structure of manhood which rome possessed in julius cæsar,who stood to him, indeed, as a kind of superior nature, to raise himabove himself. he \"fear\\'d cæsar, honour\\'d him, and lov\\'d him\"; and withthe murdered cæsar for his theme, he was for once inspired and kindledto a rapture of the truest, noblest, most overwhelming eloquence.noteworthy also is the grateful remembrance at last of his obligationsto brutus for having saved him from the daggers of the conspirators.the peoplethat many-headed, but withal big-souled creature, the multitude, ischarmingly characterized in _julius cæsar_. the common people, it istrue, are rather easily swayed hither and thither by the contagion ofsympathy and of persuasive speech; yet their feelings are in the mainright, and even their judgment in the long run is better than that ofthe pampered roman aristocracy, inasmuch as it proceeds more from theinstincts of manhood. shakespeare evidently loved to play with thenatural, unsophisticated, though somewhat childish heart of the people;but his playing is always genial and human-hearted, with a certainangelic humor in it that seldom fails to warm us towards the subject. onthe whole, he understood the people well, and they have well repaid himin understanding him better than the critics have often done. thecobbler\\'s droll humor, at the opening of this play, followed as it is bya strain of the loftiest poetry, is aptly noted by campbell as showingthat the dramatist, \"even in dealing with classical subjects, laughed atthe classic fear of putting the ludicrous and sublime intojuxtaposition.\"ix. general characteristicsas a whole, _julius cæsar_ is inferior to _coriolanus_, but it aboundsin scenes and passages fraught, with the highest virtue of shakespeare\\'sgenius. among these may be specially mentioned the second scene of thefirst act, where cassius sows the seed of the conspiracy in brutus\\'smind, warmed with such a wrappage of instigation as to assure itseffective germination; also the first scene of the second act,unfolding the birth of the conspiracy, and winding up with theinterview, so charged with domestic glory, of brutus and portia. theoration of antony in cæsar\\'s funeral is such an interfusion of art andpassion as realizes the very perfection of its kind. adapted at once tothe comprehension of the lowest mind and to the delectation of thehighest, and running its pathos into the very quick of them that hearit, it tells with terrible effect on the people; and when it is done wefeel that cæsar\\'s bleeding wounds are mightier than ever his genius andfortune were. the quarrel of brutus and cassius is deservedlycelebrated. dr. johnson thought it \"somewhat cold and unaffecting.\"coleridge thought otherwise. see note, p. 123. but there is nothing inthe play that is more divinely touched than the brief scene, alreadynoticed, of brutus and his boy lucius--so gentle, so dutiful, so loving,so thoughtful and careful for his master, and yet himself no moreconscious of his virtue than a flower of its fragrance. there is no moreexquisite passage in all shakespeare than that which tells of the boy\\'sfalling asleep in the midst of his song and exclaiming on being aroused,\"the strings, my lord, are false.\"authorities(with the more important abbreviations used in the notes)  f1 = first

        "3. Use the model to predict the next token in the sequence. Remember that the model will output a probability distribution over the vocabulary, so you'll need to use `np.argmax` to find the token with the highest probability.\n",
        "4. Add the predicted token to the sequence and remove the first token.\n",
        "5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you have generated the desired number of tokens.\n",

        "This is a challenging task, so don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. It's okay if the generated text doesn't make much sense yet - we'll work on improving the model next.\n",
        "As a bonus, you can make your method generate \"gpt-style\" by having it print out each word as it's generated, so you can see the text being generated in real time."
